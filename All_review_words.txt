not my favorite thompson (that seat is still reserved for ), but not terrible, either, underwhelming. some of the typical thompson themes are here ("you can't win" etc.), but the atmosphere just doesn't come together - except in the wonderful finale.p.s.: it's weird how the goodreads summary focuses all on the "target" of the book, even though the large majority is from the point of view of the would-be assassin.p.p.s.: there's a wonderfully typical noir scene. charlie throws up in the bathroom, and the woman immediately brings him what is expected of the genre to "settle his stomach": a glass of whisky and a cigarette. small book based on a ted-talk, but luckily without the annoying language of a ted-talk.it serves as a very brief introduction to bayesian thinking or bayesian inference, with a short intro to a world where everything has a false and a negative positive rate - here it is applied to the world of medicine, but you could (should?) also use it in politics, research, sports, economics, the way you run your company etc. i'd love to live in a world where a politician "flip-flopping" isn't a bad thing, but something to be lauded when it's a careful decision based on new information (this is a problem in scientific research, too - scientists themselves rarely "flip-flop", they just die. the younger generation then picks up the novel outlook from the start - "science advances one funeral at a time", as it is ascribed to planck).the short length of the talk/book makes criticisms of this style of thinking impossible; for example, you have to be extremely careful when choosing your data, and (un)conscious bias may make you dismiss evidence that you should have included, there can be a lot of (bad) subjectivity involved.the other two laws are less applicable to a non-researching world - 1) outliers are the source of novel laws (as the "weird" motion of mars while all other planets moved "nicely" was the source of kepler's laws). 2) human bias influences everything, even the mere act of a patient enrolling in a study introduces bias  - this is a bigger problem in medicine since you have two groups who are influenced by bias (the researchers and the patients).bonus quote:the advent of new medical technologies will not diminish bias. they will amplify it. more human arbitration and interpretation will be needed to make sense of studies - and thus more biases will be introduced. big data is not the solution to the bias problem; it is merely a source of more subtle (or even bigger) biases.(i see that in bioinformatics often - there are many sources of false positive noise, which people usually discard (unmapped reads, repetitive regions etc.), the more noise, the more is discarded. we always throw away important information - in plants, resistance genes often carry many repeats, so i've had a few cases where we had to go "dig in the garbage" for our expected resistance genes)at its best when german empty political language is taken and face value and analyzed at the level of orwell analyzing english, at its worst when it's like reading sokal's fashionable nonsense - you know it's nonsense, so you'd rather not read more of it.reality is as thin as paper and betrays with all its cracks its imitative character. at times one has the impression that it is only the small section immediately before us that falls into the expected pointillistic picture of a city thoroughfare, while on either side, the improvised masquerade is already disintegrating and, unable to endure, crumbles behind us into plaster and sawdust, into the storeroom of an enormous, empty theater. the tenseness of an artificial pose, the assumed earnestness of a mask, an ironical pathos tremble on this façade.very happy that jack tripper recommended this one so glowingly, it's amazingly unique, with such thick language - truly "weird" fiction, like a dream set in a world moved a few meters to the side: everything is strange, but it all makes sense.what's the story? it's mostly from the point of view of a young boy who lives in poland, and you never really know if the boy is weird, or if it's just dim memory of the narrator, or if the world is actually strange. nothing much happens - the boy's father slowly looses his grip of reality (maybe he wanders into our reality), and while this happens, all kinds of wondrous and outrageous things happen - a horse turns into a toy, an angry aunt becomes smaller and smaller until she turns into dust, the father collects birds from all over the world until he maybe turns into one of them, the apocalypse is announced only to be canceled.reminds me a bit of ransmayr's the last world, a bit of friedo lampe (both schulz and lampe fell victim to random world war 2 violence - one shot in a concentration camp when he met the wrong guard who didn't work under schulz's protector, one shot by the arriving soviets when he was too emaciated to look like his passport photo), a bit of that kind of half-dreamed dream you have just before waking up.three pilot pirx short stories ("test", "the patrol", "the conditioned reflex"), one excerpt from the futurological congress, and a few essays around "phantomologie" (phantomology?), which haven't been translated into english as far as i can see.the theme to all of these is in the title - the discovery of virtuality back in the 60s, 70s, when lem started to write about a world where your input comes from machines, but you can't trust these machines. the pirx short stories deal with that aspect - the pilot controls his space ship or lives in a moon colony, but he has to fully rely on his instruments, which (spoiler!) lie due to wrong measurements. 60 years ago that was a bit more revolutionary than today, where we're surrounded by unreliable technology, in a world where the gps voice tells you to turn right where there is no road, or where we've got "high tech" automated assistants who misunderstand our words and call our parents, again, or where the automated threat assessor thinks you're a potential terrorist.the excerpt from the futurological congress deals more with a reality you can't trust due to ubiquitous drugs and walks into philip k dick territory . the narrator, who lives in a rich post-scarcity society, only knows about the "common" drugs, the ones that make teenagers more rebellious, adults more well-fit, and create moods as the situation demands them - but a meeting exposes him to an anti-drug drug, which reveals that the atmosphere is full of drugs, and reality is much less glamorous than thought - instead of post-scarcity it's rust and dirt and a society in collapse. he is later exposed to yet another drug that reveals yet another layer to reality, which is even worse (an ice-age), and so on, each step revealing a more terrible reality.the essays fit into that scheme - in a world where perfect virtual reality (he doesn't call it that yet) is possible, how can we trust reality? how would you distinguish reality from virtuality (you couldn't, if the simulation is good enough)? how much can you "be" napoleon in such virtual reality without changing the layout of your brain? wouldn't such a change in layout mean murder, as the original person disappears? how can you convince someone that they're not in a virtual reality, even though you've just disconnected them ? the minute that such technology is possible (and despite the hype around oculus we're still a far bit off) we automatically stop trusting our reality.we've had these questions again and again in popular culture since then with matrix and inception and whatnot, so reading these essays right now are more archaeological fun, to see how much he foresaw and how much is yet to come, how we could deal with that, and to see with what words lem came up with for concepts that are now common-place.p.s.: what is it with lem translations being so much better in german than in english? the english versions are often wooden to the point that it even feels like reading english. same goes for strugatsky translations... amusing anecdote you probably know: both lem and dick "worked" in similar territory, but never met in person, lem always stayed in communist poland. lem published so many books and stories that dick thought lem wasn't a real person, but a communist committee publishing propaganda. he wrote a warning letter to the fbi about that.   like in that that matrix fan-theory that says that the rebel's reality is just another layer of virtual reality custom-made for them, which would explain why neo can later control machines even when he's "outside" the matrixan extremely dense, "complete" biography of goethe's life, 800 pages of information. you get everything: life, many letters, other people's memoirs, the plays and novels themselves, including interpretations of goethe's major works (one of the best, and again, complete faust interpretations i've read so far). if you'd want a biography of goethe, i'd recommend this - some problems where safranski loves goethe too much, you could easily write a much "meaner", more ruthless biography.i don't really understand why the germans love goethe so much, and i still don't (maybe it's our "obrigkeitshörigkeit"/obedience to authority?). he was against the upcoming german state, but after his death the german state used him for his propaganda (as evidence of german uniqueness - similar to japan's nihonjinron).some other notes:- goethe often wrote to escape his lebensekel (life-disgust), great word, which is the "real" reason of werther's suicide (not the unlucky love affair as it's often made out to be).- there's so much about goethe's disdain for the new industrialism, a world that is "too fast" - i wonder how much of that is safranski writing about 2013.- politically he was extremely conservative to the point of being cowardly. his monetary security was completely dependent on karl august (duke of saxe-weimar-eisenach, one of those tiny german kingdoms), so he was always for the "old" order and criticized the new democracy movements. very german, i've met germans who haven't changed their thinking since. then when the french became the dominant power and napoleon made goethe a chevalier in the legion of honour suddenly goethe was pro-french. always follow the money.- it would have been much easier to make fun about goethe's failed politics exercises. goethe didn't see himself as an author, but for quite some time as a politician. karl august gave him an elevated position in government based on personal friendship and admiration, but the large majority of government projects he started and attended were complete failures, partially due to goethe having been such a political amateur. i can't help but feel jealous of goethe's secure position - "goethe: hey can i go travel italy for a year or two while you keep on paying me so i can publish a book about it all?" - "duke karl august: yes, of course, here's some more money". goethe was lucky: upper middle-class parents, lifelong admiration and employment by a duke.- there's a lot of interesting stuff in goethe's philosophy about life: you recognize yourself because of the reflections your actions create from others, not from looking inward all day. you even need these reflections, you need others, you can't recognize yourself on your own (funny, typical goethe's ego: "don't bother with the reflections of opponents", but imho sometimes opponents have a point of view you hadn't even considered!). the best life is a pursuit of knowledge.similarly interesting the views on religion - reminded me of einstein's writings on religion, very spinoza, there is no bearded guy in the clouds, the godly is everywhere and inside you and is expressed by your actions and work. everyday actions are an indirect service to god.- goethe's relation to science was more than questionable, and hampered by his own ego. he set out to disprove newton (like that always ends well) and came up with a rather strange explanation of colors (roughly: colors happen when darkness is mixed with light), which he then pushed on anyone. goethe sent his stuff to lichtenberg who didn't include it in his physics textbook, which goethe treated like a personal attack, he broke off all contact. goethe even received a polarizer as a present, but he refused to use it (fear of having his pet-theory disproven?). if goethe were alive today he would have one of those blogs "disproving" the theory of relativity.- it's weird how often people got banned from kingdoms back then. goethe used his influence to have a former friend banned, and others got banned for being too atheistic in public. then again, german kingdoms were so tiny that a ban meant "please ride your horse for half an hour in whatever direction, if you really want to come back, write a nice letter".- here humboldt appears only a few times, curious given that goethe is such a large part of .best bonus quote:ich habe nichts getan dessen ich mich rühmen könnte, manches dessen ich mich freuen darf.translation: i have done nothing i could be proud of, but a lot i can be pleased with.ever heard of the cambridge spy ring? (i assume that one's better known inside the borders of the uk) the untouchable is the memoirs of an ex-double agent, part of british upper class, and during university part of a raucous group of students. the focus of the novel is around that group - some of them are recruited to hand secrets to the soviets during university since they're all young marxists, and many of them stay spies (including the narrator), even after they're disenchanted with the soviet union. they're all british upper class so they all automatically have good careers - the narrator winds up being knighted, his biggest "interest" nick becomes a minister.a bit of  (melancholic academia), a bit of  (spying without the action), a bit of  (homosexual life in london of the 30s-50s), and a bit of "guess who this is supposed to be" (may require knowledge of (post-)wartime uk politics - i only recognised the easy ones: turing, thatcher, and the obvious royalty).several centuries (or so) ago, in a country whose name doesn't matter, there was a tall, skinny, straggly-bearded old wizard named prospero, and not the one you are thinking of, either. he lived in a huge, ridiculous, doodad-covered, trash-filled two-story horror of a house that stumbled, staggered, and dribbled right up to the edge of a great shadowy forest of elms and oaks and maples.did you read  and thought "screw all this arthur livejournal drama, i want more merlin, i want more fun british magicians from the past who live in non-linear time"? then search for the face in the frost, the story of two merlin-like magicians who battle a foe (actually an old colleague of one of them), full of in-jokes and wordplay and old confused men who can't remember their spells. it tapers off a bit too much towards the later third and the ending isn't particularly fulfilling, but it's still a very fun way to fill an afternoon.though they could not make the moon eclipse, they could do some very striking lightning effects and make it look as thought i might rain if you waited long enough.alternative title: "how the upper class dies"autobiographical book by a guy who's trained and studied all his life, nearly became a writer, then chose to become a doctor instead (that's what happens when you come from a family of medical doctors), and is diagnosed with cancer at the end of his training. torschlusspanik  sets in and he has to write that one book he always wanted to write. it's partially an autobiography of his training, a hymn to his wife, and a bit on patient-doctor relationship.sometimes it's way too pretentious for its own good, lots of classical lit, lots of poetry quotes, lots of namedropping - who on earth reads wittgenstein to a newborn?? - and sometimes it's too sentimental and just straight-up walks into  territory. it is not an ugly death - for that the family is too well-trained in medicine to "fight" ultimately senseless fights, too well-acquainted with death to cause a fuss, too rich to die in a dump, too well-connected to suffer bad doctors.the last chapter written by the wife after his death is probably the best - still, i wouldn't recommend it, not much new, not that interesting . would make a good book for oprah's book club.i can guarantee you that yours and my death will be much worse than what is described here. here there is  no constant vomiting, no blood, no mucus, no week-long screaming from the pain. death is too clean, like the book  itself. one of the best words we have in german - literally "gate closing panic", it usually denotes a woman who starts to behave unusual once she realises that her child-bearing age window is closing, but it can be used to describe everyone who starts to behave unusual once time starts to run out it feels extremely mean to write that about a guy's work who has just diedi think it's supposed to be a pastiche of everything us horror is famous for - the small town, the ancient evil that has roamed the land since before the white settlers came, the group of friends who face the evil, the creepy wandering circus (), the old "sin" that is being avenged by the supernatural, etc. the problem is that the pace moves along at the speed of a glacier. straub tries to draw a picture of the entire village "under attack"  by adding a large group of characters, but the minor cast remains two-dimensional, and you don't really care what happens to any of them, just slogging through the descriptions of their untimely demise.you could have cut most of these, slimmed the book by about 200 pages, and gotten somewhere interesting.recommended for fans of us-style (king-style) horror, others won't miss anything. you wonder why in the early days of dead people cropping up the village doesn't just collectively say "we're off to zihuatanejo, see you in two years"let me begin with a rather embarrassing confession: no person has given me greater pleasure throughout my life than david bowie.short, personal collection of quasi-chronologically sorted essays on bowie's music and life-work starting with the ziggy phase and ending with the release of "where are we now?" (sadly no "blackstar", which is amazing). after the personal introduction (bowie as a symbol of the other for kids who grow up in terrible british suburbs, "millions of self-conscious mini-hamlets living out their loveless hells in scattered, sundry hamlets, towns, and cities"), critchley is concerned with bowie's message - what do all these fake characters mean, and can bowie reach truth by using them? is the dystopia so often described in bowie's lyrics maybe an utopia of possibility? can we re-invent ourselves in spite of our lacking authenticity? the overcoming of the human condition is a disaster, yet man is still an obstacle. we’re human, all-too-human, and yet long to overcome that condition. much of bowie’s work circles obsessively around this dilemma.sadly the book is too short, and can't really develop any depth to its arguments - still, i'd recommended it to people interested in modern human life, and one possible approach to it.p.s.: was the note bowie put on the bouquet for his brother's funeral used in blade runner?the note on bowie’s bouquet was extremely poignant: “you’ve seen more things than we can imagine, but all these moments will be lost—like tears washed away by the rain.”p.p.s.: i didn't realize how much of bowie's work is based on nietzsche or mishima or french revolutionary history, i didn't grow up with the man so i missed all thisthere was something unreal about the pictures, which may have come from the face, the ultimate in tragedy, of a man so disciplined in an art that he had lost the better part of reality.just like  or the majority of yukio mishima's work, master of go belongs to that corner of japanese culture in favor of the "old" (meiji-era) and against the "new" (western influence, loss of values etc.). it may be said that the master was plagued in his last match by modern rationalism, to which fussy rules were everything, from which all the grace and elegance of go as art had disappeared, which quite dispensed with respect for elders and attached no importance to mutual respect as human beings. from the way of go the beauty of japan and the orient had fled. everything had become science and regulation.it's about the retirement match of the go master/honinbō shūsai with kitani minoru (in the book called otake), you can go through the steps of the match here. kawabata wrote newspaper columns about the 6-months spanning match which he reworked into this book. a little bit of knowledge of the game may be required reading but the rules are relatively simple and fast to pick up.the match began in tokyo on june 26, 1938, at the kōyōkan restaurant in shiba park, and ended on december 4, in itō, at the dankōen inn. a single game took almost half a year. there were fourteen sessions. my report was serialized in sixty-four installments.you can ignore any go-specific terms in the book, it's not really about the game anyway - it's about japan and its supposed uniqueness: china's go isn't "real go", that supposedly developed in japan - other foreigners have no clue of go, "the spirit of go" is missing, etc., and if you can stand that, go for it.this would work very well if you're about to start a university degree that supposed you did some "higher" mathematics in high school and you need an introduction, or a refresher - you'll learn what all of those greek symbols do (university-level notation), you'll learn about the kind of precise language you need, how to structure proofs, types of proofs, etc. the language is the best part. it's never particularly dry or boring, devlin knows how to structure what he wants to convey. however, most of the content i already had back in my "mathematik leistungskurs"  so i've had all this before - why did i read it then? curiosity about the title, i guess. i thought there would be more "how to think", less "how to write". but you've got to start somewhere, i guess.for a hundred years the valley had been the center of steel production in the country, in the entire world, technically, but in the time since poe and isaac were born, the area had lost 150,00 jobs - most of the towns could no longer afford basic services; many no longer had any police. as isaac had overheard his sister tell someone from college: half the people went on welfare and the other half went back to hunting and gathering. which has an exaggeration, but not by much.last year i read , a non-fiction book about the unraveling of us-society told in a few interwoven stories based on interviews. american rust could be straight out of these interviews - it's set in a former steel-working valley, all the mills have closed, everyone is unemployed, the middle-aged are leaving, only the very young and the very old stay. the story focuses on two young people: isaac is "book-smart" not "street-smart", poe is exactly the opposite, and of course they're good friends (if isaac had no working legs they would be freak the mighty). isaac wants to leave this existence behind and run away from his family and go somewhere where the clocks haven't stopped, poe tags on for a while, but both immediately run into a catastrophe which takes the rest of the book to deal with.the language is straightforward with many run-on sentences that work well, but it convincingly manages to create an oppressive atmosphere, you can feel the lack of future:the bank changed the locks and his wife took the daughter to houston and virgil's cousin broke into his own house and shot himself in the kitchen. everyone in the valley had a story like that - it was a horror show.sometimes the story makes a few not-so-elegant turns and you can't really decide whether isaac is supposed to be rainman or just a smart kid, but still, impressive. (not the smartest choice to finish on christmas)clearly intended as the start to a trilogy, not that interesting on its own; interesting in that not alien life, but other humans are the biggest "problem", to the point that a oppressive atmosphere develops on its owna follow-up to dyson's earlier , both collections of essays from the nyrb that start out as book-reviews and end up as general reflections.this one wasn't as much fun as the earlier collection - mostly because the grandiosity just isn't here. in the scientist as rebel, dyson speculates about how to use genetically modified plants to terraform asteroids - there's a little bit like that here in dreams of earth and sky, notably in speculation about gene editing tools becoming common playsets for children, but that's it - what you get instead is more dyson putting himself into the contrarian's position to the mainstream: environmentalism is too much "doom and gloom", global warming is overstated because the models are inaccurate, plants may take care of the majority of excess co2, passive detectors may be more useful to focus on than particle accelerators, etc.what still makes these essays enjoyable:- most reviews are about books on the history of science (or more general, the history of thought), which is a great way to find some new books to read- dyson himself had contact to so many "greats" of science that to each biography he writes about he can "donate" a few additional personal viewpoints or anecdotes. he visited some of wittgenstein's courses as an undergrad and hated him back then, he worked under oppenheimer for 20 years, or this wonderful feynman anecdote:he never showed the slightest resentment when i published some of his ideas before he did. he told me that he avoided disputes about priority in science by following a simple rule: “always give the bastards more credit than they deserve.” i have followed this rule myself. i find it remarkably effective for avoiding quarrels and making friends. a generous sharing of credit is the quickest way to build a healthy scientific community.i'm stealing that rule!- one of the best essays is the one summarizing the us military's  "secret" report on insurgents called oregon trail, which he had access to when he visited the rand corporation:the most important conclusion of the oregon trail study was that the rebels usually won if the empire spent most of its effort on military operations, but that the rebels usually lost if the empire spent most of its effort on political and social responses to grievances. it was obvious to anyone who read oregon trail that the american war in vietnam was likely to be a losing proposition. unfortunately, very few people had a chance to read it. by one of the worst abuses of the secrecy system that i ever encountered, the military authorities stamped the whole thing secret.wish i could read it! even wikipedia has only a dead link to a non-existing article...(this summary is part of a favorable review of gladwell's david and goliath, interestingly enough)recommended for: people looking for something smart to readthe basic argument: society/economy used to be based on "cogs", people who just did their jobs, that doesn't work anymore, the new economy needs "linchpins", people who turn their job into an art, who invent, who "draw the map" of the business; the internet economy has made that possible, you can now share or connect without any middlemen, you can stand out. it's hard to become a "linchpin" since your "lizard brain" scares you into mediocrity, you should learn to deal with the fear and start giving "gifts", work or art or connections or emotional work given, with no return expected, then people will start to notice you and "join your tribe" of connections.like many similar books it spends quite a while on repeating and hammering in the arguments, that would make the book 50% shorter. still, it's oddly motivational, to me a very welcome change to the usual "life sucks and then your kids hang themselves in your closet" books i normally read - it's so optimistic and cheerful that you're automatically want to give more gifts. (in the same way, 99% of goodreads reviews are pure gifts - nothing is expected in return, except perhaps a "like" or a comment).collection of essays on various books and writers, great to see such breadth of reading. the only problem is that many essays are prefaces, so they assume that you've either just read or are going to read the book, and since neither me nor you haven't, they're a bit of a shot in the dark. nevertheless, some good starting points if you want to leave the comfort zone of the stuff you're usually reading.titular essay herea few bits of the martian, a few bits of the way americans like to see themselvesa large collection of more than a thousand aphorisms (and a few poems and dialogues) split up into two books. the first book is split up by theme (morality, religion, the state, women etc.) - the second book is more loosely structured. you get a ton of thoughts ranging from a few sentences to a few pages; the best part being that you can see how cleanly nietzsche develops a thought over a few inter-connected aphorism (and then comes back to it later, only to refute it). it's like reading through nietzsche's process of thought.you can see that there's almost ten years between both books; the second half is more mature, has less jokes, but is sometimes more cryptic and harder to interpret, but still, much more enjoyable.there are some recurring themes that are worth going through -1) the dream of europe. quite often he praises the european idea, of having many nations come together as "cantons" into one network of states. to him europe has a specific goal and task:desshalb muss jetzt ein jeder, der gut europäisch gesinnt ist, gut und immer besser schreiben lernen: es hilft nichts, und wenn er selbst in deutschland geboren ist, wo man das schlecht-schreiben als nationales vorrecht behandelt. besser schreiben aber heisst zugleich auch besser denken; immer mittheilenswertheres erfinden und es wirklich mittheilen können; übersetzbar werden für die sprachen der nachbarn; zugänglich sich dem verständnisse jener ausländer machen, welche unsere sprache lernen; dahin wirken, dass alles gute gemeingut werde und den freien alles frei stehe; endlich, jenen jetzt noch so fernen zustand der dinge vorbereiten, wo den guten europäern ihre grosse aufgabe in die hände fällt: die leitung und ueberwachung der gesammten erdcultur.translation:that's why anybody who's european-minded has to learn to write well and always better - it doesn't help when he's born in germany, where "bad-writing" is treated as national privilege. to write better means to think better; to come up with things worthy of communication, and to communicate them; to become translatable for the languages of the neighbors; to become accessible to those foreigners who learn our language; work towards that all good becomes common good and that the free are free to everything; finally, to prepare this now so distant state of affairs, where the good europeans have their grand task at hand: the management and supervision of earth's culture. you'd like to see that in the eu, wouldn't you? so far all we've done is to misinterpret "supervision of earth's culture" as "let's start five eyes, build echelon and spy on everybody"2) critical thought - you should change your opinions, you shouldn't trust anyone, you should be critical towards every thought. you change your clothes regularly, so why don't you do the same with your opinions?3) there's a very smart part about how much of a self-defeating thing it is that countries are keeping armies "solely for defense purposes", as that implies that only the neighbors are the "bad" guys and oneself has nothing but "good" thoughts, culminating in: lieber zu grunde gehen, als hassen und fürchten, und zweimal lieber zu grunde gehen, als sich hassen und fürchten machen, — diess muss einmal auch die oberste maxime jeder einzelnen staatlichen gesellschaft werden!rough translation:it's better to collapse than to hate and fear, and it's better to collapse twice than to make yourself hated and feared - some day this has to be the topmost maxim of every society!i'm reminded of the recent reactions to daesh.4) on e-mails: der brief ist ein unangemeldeter besuch, der briefbote der vermittler unhöflicher ueberfälle. man sollte alle acht tage eine stunde zum briefempfangen haben und darnach ein bad nehmen.transl.the letter is an unannounced visit, the postman the agent of a rude invasion. every 8 days you should have an hour to receive letters and then you should take a bath.5) on gender there's quite a lot of outdated thought but at least he "saves himself" by stating that this is due to the state of society and not due to some inherent difference:man kann in den drei oder vier civilisirten ländern europa’s aus den frauen durch einige jahrhunderte von erziehung alles machen, was man will, selbst männer, freilich nicht in geschlechtlichem sinne, aber doch in jedem anderen sinne.in the three or four civilized countries europe's you can use education to make anything out of women in a few centuries, even men, of course not in the biological/bodily sense, but in any other sense.6) the greeks, goethe, and arts - nietzsche has some very strong opinions on art, and sees the greeks as the biggest humans who ever lived, with only goethe having come close to their genius ("goethe was above the germans and still is above them - he will never belong to them")of course you don't have to agree with anything he states (and a lot of it is outdated and sometimes weird) but it's still a wealth of information to learn, and i assume a good starting point to nietzsche's thought in general, or as a manual on "how to structure your thoughts".good, detailed biography of humboldt, with an emphasis not so much on the details of scientific work, but on the overarching idea of "everything in nature is connected".  there's a lot about data exchange with other scientists, what we'd call "open data" nowadays, and some fun stuff about how extremely active humboldt was in "science communication and outreach" with free lectures and a ton of letters written to scientists and lay people (about 3000 letters per year towards the end of his life).  then there's all the proto-enviromentalism, humboldt's views on the abuse of natural resources by humans, his open campaigning against slavery, his "lonely life" (refreshing to see extremely little speculation here about humboldt's sexuality, who cares), the mix of science and poetry, all described by an author who knows how to write and how to structure relatively complicated information for an interested "lay" audience.sometimes the book goes overboard with the love for humboldt, from what i've read humboldt wasn't that much of an influence on darwin's work, but here  suddenly humboldt is a bigger influence than malthus on darwin:there is no doubt that malthus provided what darwin called 'a theory by which to work', but the seeds of this theory had been sown much earlier when he had read humboldt's work.after description of humboldt's death the book ends with a few "mini" biographies of people somewhat or a little bit influenced by humboldt, biographies of george perkins marsh, john muir, ernst haeckel,it's interesting how little-known humboldt is nowadays in the english-speaking world, and i don't know what really caused this - the author mentions anti-german sentiment during ww1, but maybe it was just time.recommended for: people interested in (early) history of scienceis this the same book houellebecq has been writing for 20 years? yes.is it fun to read? sometimes it's hilarious, more often it's horny-old-man-heinlein-awkward.is it "racist" or "anti-islam"? not exactly, even though the "pro islam" explanations especially in regards to natural selection/biology by the characters are very flawed, and i don't know whether that's intentional and part of the satire.is this worth the hype and all the press? no.recommended for: houellebecq fans.not recommended for: no-one else.one fun thing about our existence is that there's an unspoken truce we have with our body - our organs, our immune system, our endosymbionts, they're all keeping us alive without any contact between "us" and "them".  it just works! and you're reading this while a few phagocytes kill off a parasite in your eyes, they just saved you from going blind, and you don't even know.parasite eve fits a bit into the body horror genre (more famous for cronenberg movies) - mitochondria aren't "the powerhouse of the cell", they're parasites that have been waiting from the day of the first phagocytosis. in the story one of these parasite networks has "developed consciousness" (and telepathy and telekinesis and the ability to speak in italics), she's looking for a suitable host and a father of the next generation of "mitochondrial eves" (you know, maternal inheritance of mitochondria and whatnot). that father is - of course - a biologist so we get lots of fun details from the daily life of a biologist (there's a fun little bit where everyone's over the moon for just having been published in nature, and who wouldn't be!). the monster appears like the mother at the end of "braindead" , and is then defeated for some lousy reason, aaaand then the book's over, and in parts it's even exciting!now to the bad. the first half is extremely, ridiculously, who-needs-sleeping-pills dry. here's an example:the human body has a main abdominal artery and vein through which a great amount of blood flows. the arteries which supply blood to the kidneys extend from this main artery. similarly, the kidney veins are linked to the abdominal vein. the abdominal artery and vein each fork out in the lower abdominal region and continue into both legs. the balloon-tip catheter had been inserted up through this lower arterial branch to reach the kidney extension, and the balloons then inflated to interrupt blood flow in the abdominal artery.and that's just a tiny excerpt! you can easily skip the first half of the book and the only thing you'll have missed is an in-depth manual on how to transplant a kidney. but maybe you need to know that? maybe you're one of those doctors who faked their way into the operating theater, and now you're nervously making it up as you go along? boy have i got the book for you!bonus cheese quote:toshiaki screamed. something was being sucked out from the center of his genome. he shouted "no, no!" but it was useless.no john, you are the demons!p.s.: if your curiosity into mitochondria is piqued, have a look at nick lane's the vital question for a very recent summary (with some speculation) of the research that movie is called "dead alive" when you have no health-caremodernity was perhaps an error, thought jed for the first time in his life. a purely rhetorical question, that: modernity had ended in western europe some time ago.i once tried to get into houellebecq , about 10 years ago, and back then his work seems to have been all about "here's a bunch of sex with various people, oh no this is not fulfilling, we need monogamy, the end". not that interesting. the map and the territory does not fit into that pattern at all, luckily, it's more a character study of two sides of the same coin - jed and houellebecq himself, the first some kind of visual artist who drifts from photography to painting, the second a relatively successful french author who's hired to write the introduction to a catalogue of jeb's work. both are extremely similar with little attachment to "real life", both have little to no friends and are drifting through life. both have found success without really aiming for it, both just made their art when it came to them with no real aim to become rich or famous with it. there was truly in beigbeder, as far as he could remember, something which could arouse affection and, already, the existence of “loved ones”; something that did not exist in houellebecq, nor in him : a sort of familiarity with life.france, culturally and linguistically, always feels like a bit of a self-imposed island to me - the french language is imposed by law, and french modern books focus more on navel-gazing than anything else. houellebecq nearly walks into that trap with a bit of too much satire of the french cultural elite, but he luckily looks past france. there's a bit of history of computing and silicon valley, tocqueville, especially surprising to find a reference to hakim bey's temporary autonomous zone. he even touches jack womack's territory in a few lines where some areas in paris have devolved into some kind of proto-anarchy; but where womack then walks into these territories and stages laser axe-fights between hopped up 13-year olds and robocops, houellebecq just mentions them and immediately leaves to focus on his characters. i guess this is something h. revisits in soumission, i yet have to read that one.the last third is a bit unnecessary, there's a brutal murder, and sadly the murder is resolved, and even more sadly the murderer is dead so that no (psychological) explanation is necessary, almost as if h. didn't know how to end the story. that first "e" has no earthly business in a last nameweislingen, you idiot!a history, and the psychology, and what we should learn from the holocaust. the central thesis is that statelessness is a prerequisite for murder on such a scale, evidenced by the fact that jews as citizens of functioning states (even of germany) survived in greater numbers than jews of destroyed states, such as poland.if jews were to be removed from the planet, they first had to be separated from the state. as she  wrote later, “one could do as one pleased only with stateless people.”on the way snyder tries to right some myths - like the one that only nazis killed in large numbers yet the nazis managed to usually recruit the local population, or that the united states intentionally rescued jews from genocide (the us gave 4,705 visas to jews from july 42 to june 43, less than were murdered per day in 1942 in treblinka).age-old antisemitism cannot explain why pogroms began precisely in summer 1941. such an explanation ignores the suggestive fact that pogroms were most numerous where germans drove out soviet power, and the obviously material fact that the instigation of pogroms in such places was explicit german policy.the latter is explained with psychology - citizens who used to collaborate with the soviets could "clean themselves" in the eyes of the germans by participating in pogroms - "the judeobolshevik myth, spread locally by militias, provided the perfect escape route for most soviet collaborators", a collective rewriting of history, it wasn't the soviets, it was the jews, with the added bonus of being able to take the houses and belongings of the murdered jews.psychology plays a large part in the last third, which is more positive - why did various people and groups save jews? it's almost as if the author included these parts to save his own belief in humanity.the last chapter "conclusion" is all about what we can learn from this - part of the panic that gave rise to hitler was rising prices for food, which was much more expensive than nowadays thanks to the green revolution (norman borlaug is severely under-appreciated). we face similar problems with climate change, and if we don't change, we may fall into the same trap. we can't afford to chip away at the states, either in the name of neoliberalism, or in the name of the left. we need states and their institutions:when states are absent, rights—by any definition—are impossible to sustain. states are not structures to be taken for granted, exploited, or discarded, but are fruits of long and quiet effort. it is tempting but dangerous to gleefully fragment the state from the right or knowingly gaze at the shards from the left.i could pull out quotes all day.p.s.: bonus-quip:the righteous few were behaving in a way that a norm based upon economic calculations of personal welfare would regard as irrational.p.p.s.: did you know that poland funded many early zionist (and militant zionist) organizations? i didn't! the history of these small paramilitary organizations like betar forms a small, but very interesting part.nothing much happens - an old couple and their adult daughter live together in some kind of counter-protecting dependency in a small village in hungary in the year 1899. each side is trying to protect the other from realizing that their lives never really started. the daughter, for the first time ever, visits distant relatives, and in that one week the stalemate evaporates.what happens here in so little story is psychologically so well-drawn, and so finely structured - if you've ever walked past a house with the lights on and voices coming from inside and you've felt nothing but sadness and thought "is this it?", then this book is for you.stalker (the movie) meets lem's eden and solaris meets junji ito's the enigma of amigara fault meets ransmayr's the last worldrecommended reading for an alternative look on the crusades - just supported with copious quotes by arab historians, no "western" sources. extremely interesting to see this clash of cultures from the "other" side - "our" extremely brutal fighters with little moral qualms, slaughtering everyone in their path in most brutal ways, the "early" arabs being wholly unprepared and completely confused by so much religious zealotry. especially the epilogue, linking this story to modern developments of the 1980s, 1990s makes it worth reading.some notes:- wonderful words used: "panegyrists", "quinquagenarian", "suzerainty" etc.- franj medicine and judiciary, what a weird mess. got a disease? let's cut a cross into your scalp and pour salt on it. oh, this kills you? ¯\_(ツ)_/¯ (then again, there's at least one review here that says the relevant quote is cut to make it seem more extreme, but the relevant link is dead and not on google)- saladin is portrayed as an extremely generous leader, someone who didn't slaughter or sell the population of a fallen city. however, was the generosity worth it? it made him look benevolent, and no plundering meant no income from the war. his pardoned enemies quickly regrouped, after his death his empire immediately fell apart, and the franj regained some of their strength. on the other opposite, the concentrated brutality of the mamluks was the force that after 200 years finally drove the crusaders/franj out of near east.- the sunni/shia conflict features prominently - and it still features prominently in our times, virtually unchanged.- the sacking of the assassin's library in alamut makes me more sad than it logically should, so much unique knowledge lost (unlike the library of alexandria, which had copies of most of its content in other cities). - straight out of sun tzu's "art of war", there are at least 20 cases where group a corners group b, and group b fights so full of despair that group a is routed. see for example zangi's siege of damascus.- most of the initial success of the first crusade was more due to muslim infighting, confusion, and political instability than due to any strategic or technical superiority (except for the crusaders' full-body armor, which was worn only by the rich knights of the army).recommended for: those who'd like to take up a different perspective from time to time.note: you can get the 2nd edition for free from the authors here: http://graphdatabases.com/a good introduction to neo4j, less to graph databases in general. it goes from the basics, to using the query language cypher, to some use-cases, internal technologies, and a quick primer on graph algorithms (dijkstra's algorithm, a*).very american, the tone is overenthusiastic to the point of being hilarious:graph databases lack the kind of schema-oriented data governance mechanisms we're familiar with in the relational world. but this is not a risk; rather, it calls forth a far more visible and actionable kind of governance.translated: it's ok to give children live hand-grenades. but this is not a risk; just give them some rules for handling explosives.it's similar overenthusiastic in the benchmarks, and there's an absolutely unholy code-example showing how to extract all nodes from a range of dates with no comment that a whole page of code with several matches for a date1 bit too complicated. then again, the authors made the database and work for the company that makes all of its money with neo4j. at times the book feels more like a company white-paper.the later chapters get more interesting - testing using java, technical details of the implementation, algorithms, architecture patterns, caching etc. i would have liked more technical details but these are out there (and there are a few useful paper and book recommendations, here too!)recommended for: people who want to get their feet wet with graph databases, but don't want too much of the technical detailsa good friend of h.p. lovecraft, and it shows - both "universes" overlap a bit (the necromonicon and yog-sothoth make an appearance here, for example), but smith also came up with his own books. there are two differences: smith vocabulary  is humongous compared to lovecraft. where everything "moves blasphemously" for lovecraft, smith does this:all the hideous things that had swarmed upon me beneath the cacophonous beating of those accursed gongs, drew near again for a moment; and i looked with fearful vertigo into hells of perversity and corruption. i saw an inverted soul, despairing of good, which longed for the baleful ecstasies of perdition. no longer did i think him merely mad: for i knew the thing which he sought and could attain; and i remembered, with a new significance, that line of baudelaire's poem - "l'enfer dont mon coeur se plait."(which, by the way, is a misquote as the footnotes explain). smith has a much better rhythm and feels much more natural to read, compared to lovecraft who often feels clunky or forced. but, smith just isn't as original in "worldbuilding" as lovecraft - contrary to lovecraft smith's stories are often set in a relatively generic fantasy world in which some evil wizard does something evil (for added strangeness everybody's name starts with an x or a z), stories that could have worked in one thousand and one nights, but feel weird and not very original coming from a relatively recent american author. i felt similar about the prose poems and the poems, but smith's language makes it worth.however, smith's overflow of adjectives and adverbs doesn't always work out:xeethra plunged incontinently into the dark cave.recommended for: fans of lovecraft, or those who love overflowing language as a side: the german word "wordschatz" is so much better than your "vocabulary". "wordschatz" literally means "treasure of words", a much more apt description.very short book collecting reich-ranicki's answers to readers' questions from the fas's "ask marcel reich-ranicki" column. since these are weekly their quality varies - some are way too short and you wind up wishing to read more, some are of exactly the right length, like this short one (translation from me, german original here):q: literature is known to be allowed to be everything, except to be boring. why is german literature before 1933 - from arthur schnitzler to thomas mann - so thrilling, and why has it become so boring after 1945?to this question the singular answer:a: she has not become boring, it's just that some readers haven't grown enough yet.similar to reich-ranicki's autobiography, this is a good source of anecdotes on the german literature scene from the 50s to the 80s, and a good source for recommendations for german-language writers. if you're into neither then this is definitely not for you.  there are some thoughts on famous english-language writers (especially the answer on hemingway is great, basically: he's so popular in germany post-1945 since he's makes for great reading when you've just lost a war. hemingway is all about the loser) but not enough to warrant recommending this to the english-reading world.only dilettantes and washouts produce consistently on the same level.a relatively interesting collection of short stories, i assume more interesting to americans than to anyone else. ambrose bierce is famous for his wit and sarcasm, but here another side is shown - about half of the book is stories of the civil war, of which bierce himself was a veteran. these stories are not "fun", they're sometimes heroic, but more often about war's random chaos:"and could you not have known - could you not see, sir, that you were attacking our own men?" the reply was astounding!"i knew that, general. it appeared to be none of my business."the other half (the "...and civilians") part of the book is less enticing. the ghost stories don't go past "spooky", but there are quite a few hilarious satirical stories where bierce's wit shines (and most of them strangely fascinated with parricide):one day, when in a fit of peevish temper, i had taken the liberty to cut off the baby's ear, her  simple words, "john, you surprise me!" appeared to me so sharp a reproof that after a sleepless night i went to her in tears, and throwing myself at her feet, exclaimed: "mother, forgive me for surprising you."reading these you can feel why bierce is mostly remembered for his satire.extremely interesting, and challenging read. can you look at evolution not through the lens of (population) genetics but through the lens of biochemistry, specifically, energy. lane starts at the "beginning" - how come the last common eukaryotic ancestor already possessed so many complicated traits? he goes to introduce an origin of life that depends on energy in the form of protein gradients, and argues that life depending on protein gradients can only evolve under very constrained circumstances - therefore, life on other planets should evolve very similarly (i'm reminded of gleick's the information, making similar points about the development of writing). from there he goes on to hypothesize about the evolution of complex(er) cells, the interaction of mitochondrial and nuclear genomes in the development of different life-spans and sexuality, and more.there's a tom of interesting stuff here, it's definitely a novel perspective.some pet-peeves remain: for example, like dan brown lane can't introduce scientists without giving them a positive adjective like "eminent" - you can't help but feel a bit "propaganda'd". in times it reads like lane is channeling sagan, and you can't help but feel that there was someone shouting "isn't this amazing!?!" while writing it - in other cases it's more like reading a textbook with very dry descriptions of the involved biochemistry.recommended for: biologists, laypeople interested in the origins of lifea strange little tale - a little bit bildungsroman, a lot of 70s "freakiness" (quote from afterword), apparently for some reason categorized as sf even though no typical sf tropes appear; 4 university students, each of them a cliché (the gay sociopath, the jewish intelligenzbestie, the jock farmer, the rich guy) set out to attain immortality from a forgotten order as described in a forgotten book one of them found by accident. one has to be sacrificed, one has to commit suicide, so that the other two may live forever.is it good? not sure - the 4 alternating voices quickly blur into one and have to be forcefully distinguished, the plot takes forever to pick up only to cut off. i'm not sure who this is for - if you're an undergrad looking for yourself, it might be yours. it was morning, and the sun was gleaning and grinning generously, regardless of earthquakes, murders, or even hitler.very fun little book about a laconic, fat, unassuming detective named doan, paired up with an enormous, but mostly aloof dog with the wonderfully absurd name carstairs, and their little adventure in mexico.  it's not really "hard-boiled", for that the dialogue and humor is too absurd - it would, however, work very well as a stage-play. some people do get murdered, some get shot. at times it's more like douglas adams' "dirk gently's holistic detective agency" (as when doan describes how he makes his money), at other times it dabbles in hard-boiled (unassuming strangers are found to hide some deadly weaponry). sadly the ending pans out exactly as expected, and overall there's nothing "new" here.i originally found this in monk's biography of wittgenstein with the note that it was wittgenstein's favorite fiction book. as with so many books, it's hard to tell from afar why someone loves a book. sometimes a book finds you at exactly the right moment, and others won't understand. i still love rosendorfer's great solo for anton and as far as i know it's forgotten and out of print, interesting to no-one."mr. doan," janet said, worried, "are you sure you feel alright?""marvelous," doan answered."well, i've never had much experience with intoxicants. i've never seen anyone just sit down and- and get drunk.""stick around, kid," doan told her. "stick around."bored and disgusted as on every miserable day, salim and his colleagues were sweeping a street market after an oil tanker had exploded nearby, incinerating chickens, fruit and vegetables, and some people.i can't remember where i read this about magical realism: "the mundane is extraordinary, and the extraordinary is mundane". the usual example is the block of ice in 100 years of solitude - everyone freaks out about the ice, but ghosts are a regular and common experience, warranting just a shrug of the shoulders.it's a little bit different in the corpse exhibition - here, the extraordinary is mundane (jinns, people who can make knifes disappear, almost magical blonde twins, and more), but there is no "normal" to compare against - it's either the kuwait war, or the iran/iraq war, or yet another american invasion. people die the most gruesome deaths, but the narrator never goes out of his way to flourish the violence, the most violent and senseless acts are narrated like a mere fact of life.not recommended for: the squeamishyou can only read this with american history in the background - we have a planet in the faraway future, mankind has colonised the stars and quickly split up into several sub-species, most of their inter-species contact long forgotten (though it's implied not too much has changed physically).it's mostly settled around one of the rich big houses, colonists on the planets, who've taken their land from the natives (think native americans, on horses-not-named-horses carrying rifles). here's the first chance for vance to play with american history and he just throws it away - the new owners are really nice, no-one goes into slavery, it's actually better for the natives etc. pp., you've heard it before. more chances appear - not even "cross-species" sexuality happens (except a little bit with the titular character), what a nice coincidence that the native women look appalling to the new owners. similarly, the end twist of the natives not being the first one either makes everything just too easy - "why should we feel bad about taking their land if they're not the first ones?"people are described in long lists of adjectives, even while talking to others people are assigned a triumvirate of adjectives. the female side-character realises her love for a man out of the blue and for no reason. the group trying to take the land from the new owners to give it back to the natives sees the error of their foolish ways. most of the status quo is preserved and that's a good thing. everything's just too convenient.in short: forgettablei have hated you in every hour that goes by, i hate you so that i would happily give my life for your death, and happily go to my own doom if only i could witness yours, take you with me into the depths.very interesting perspective on the national socialist rule of germany under hitler - the author is a self-styled conservative aristocratic reactionary monarchist, a perspective you don't usually get in anti-hitler writings. according to him, germany suffers from the rise of the "mass-man", the cog in the wheel without "selbstreflexion", without care for his past or culture:mass-man moves, robotlike, from digestion to sleeping with his peroxide-blonde females, and produces children to keep the termite heap in continued operation. he repeats word for word the incantations of the great manitou, denounces or is denounced, dies or is made to die, and so goes on vegetating. and there is not even a blush when he is confronted by the legacy of his fathers, by the monuments of a noble past, by the crowning achievements of his own culture.he hates hitler and the nsdap for their "prussianness" (reck styles himself as a anti-prussian bavarian, which still has the wonderful "saupreissn", pig prussians), their loud, blind and empty core, he hates the all-encompassing belief technology, he thinks that parliaments are chaotic and useless, he loves the scholls - both for knowing how to live and knowing how to die - but he dislikes the soldiers around the stauffenberg plot for doing too little too late, after the military itself allowed hitler to rise to power.the annotation in the nyrb edition does a good job of picking up when reck repeats unsubstantiated rumors as facts, and the afterword on reck's "game of the self" is splendid. however it doesn't translate (or even note) some peculiar german turns of the phrase like "trained in radau", which doesn't mean a city but more "trained in noisemaking".recommended for: people interested in the third reich; people who're sick of reading "the usual" about this time and would like a unique perspectivep.s.: how can it be that i can easily buy the english translation of this in australia, but there's simply no ebook in german? as usual, german publishing lags behind the times.a history of science told in many lives - each chapter focusing on one aspect of the history of science, with the chapter itself being a chronologically ordered story of scientific lives. in that aspect, it's very much like bell's men of mathematics (gr link, my review), not only is the scientists structured similarly, the humorous tone and fun anecdotes are similar too:henry was painfully shy and hardly ever went out except to scientific gatherings - even at these, latecomers sometimes found him standing outside the door trying to pluck up enough courage to enter, long after he was a respected scientist in his own right. he communicated with his servants by writing them notes, wherever possible; and there are several stories about how on unexpectedly encountering a woman he did not know, he would shield his eyes with his hand and literally run away.since the author himself is a astrophysicist the focus is a bit more on physics, cosmology and astrophysics than on medicine or biology - two chapters are on biology (one on lyell -> darwin -> wallace, one on mendel -> many more i haven't heard of before (nice! ever heard of miescher?) -> crick/watson), only one part of a chapter is on medicine, one chapter on geology, the rest is physics (but that is a truth of the history of science - for a long time, western scientists focused more on the stars and mechanics than on the human body).some more aspects i noted:- science shifted from a (often rich) gentleman's hobby to a full-time profession sometime around darwin's life. i got nostalgic for a time where you could just work your whole life for a king without having to fill out grant applications every few years; but then again, you'd be dependent on the king's whims and mortality. plus, with only a few outliers it was practically impossible for a "poor" person to even begin with scientific work.- the descriptions of galileo's and bruno's troubles with the church are great - none of the usual "martyrs for science!" stuff, more (correct) focus on political and theological problems here. the history of scientists has, weirdly enough, quite a few arians in it.- gribbin goes through great pain to make it clear that to become "a name" in the history of science, it's often not some mythological personal genius, but luck of being the right hard-working person at the right position at the right time. he often details the people who also made the important discovery at the same time as the "famous" discoverer made it, but for some reason, have been forgotten by history.- fallopian tubes are called "tubes" even though fallopio originally described them as "brass trumpets", i.e., tubas - "tubes" is a mistranslation.- gribbin is no fan of newton - although his discoveries were manifold and important, his rather extreme personality made work for other scientists very hard, and the cult of newton's personality after newton's death kept progress in some areas of science behind. gribbin correctly points out that newton didn't receive the knighthood for his scientific advances, but as "a rather grubby bit of political opportunism by halifax as part of his attempt to win the election of 1705".- especially towards the end this book gets more dry, almost as if gribbin had a deadline coming up and slogged through writing it- dalton discovered colour blindness, as he himself suffered from it. imagine making that discovery!!- gribbin's not a big fan of kuhnian scientific revolutions, as the structure and the afterword of this book make it clear. to him, scientific progress is developed "essentially incremental, step-by-step".recommended for: scientists, people interested in history or the history of sciencewhite fang and call of the wild are practically the same story, with one being the mirror image of the other. white fang sees a wild dog/wolf mix become slowly domesticated, call of the wild sees a domesticated dog become slowly wild.the tone is simplistic, there's not much depth here, straight adventure stories not based on survival of the fittest, but on survival of the strongest. light, quick reading, some may be put off by all the brutality. very engrossing autobiography - written in a very simple style (good for those studying german?) - these memoirs deal with the author's youth in germany from 1893, over the first world war, to his work with the bavarian räterepublik and his subsequent imprisonment for the involvement.the best part of this is the detailed description of the chaos in germany between the first and the second world war - something that was in my high school classes mostly used as a prelude to hitler, not as its own phenomena.recommended for: people on the lookout for autobiographies in the vein of klemperer or reckin the near future (or the future of a different past), artificial replacement organs have become commonplace. they're sold by huge corporations under less than generous contracts for huge amounts of money, so when customers stop paying, it's the job of bio repo men to break into their homes, taze them, and extract the organ so it can be sold to someone else. since it's the "future" that means death for the customer, a cynical receipt is left on the body.it's the story of one of the top repo men (naturally) who falls from the company's grace and becomes hunted himself (naturally) and grows as a person while being hunted (naturally), luckily he never becomes the complete "turned around" cliché. he still cites company procedure when he finds yet another decapitated body.the book's similar in tone and setting to jack womack's books (especially random acts of senseless violence), or the judge dredd comics, so if you're a fan of those, you probably can't go wrong here, all others might want to skip this.the train, in america, is not a choice. it is a punishment for, having neglected to read weber on the protestant ethic and the spirit of capitalism, making the mistake of remaining poor.this one finds me at exactly the right time as an early career researcher supposed to find his own niche.this book is about mlodinow starting out at caltech, with a very good phd thesis that made some waves in the physics community, but also with a serious case of impostor's syndrome. on his floor, just two doors down, is a dying feynman, not far from that, murray gell-mann's office - the relationship between both as well as their relative outlook on life is the undercurrent of this book, with a larger focus on mlodinow's tapes of his conversations with feynman (including many direct quotes). if you've read feynman's autobiography, then you won't discover much new here - the outlook feynman describes here has been thoroughly. there are some choice quotes though:  "but the theory has been around for fifteen years", i said. "okay", he  said, "so not only is it bullshit, it is old bullshit."on the basis of his promising thesis mlodinow got a very strange job at caltech - no supervisor, no grant attached to a specific project, no teaching, pure research freedom. personally i'd say that would work amazingly with 10% of all scientists - the other 90%, including me, would turn into a pillar of salt from pure stress. the "pep talk" described here given by the head of school listing all these famous nobel prize winners just would make everything worse, and i could only nod when mlodinow described his gradually worsening impostor syndrome ("what if my thesis was just a one-off outlier?").what he describes here is how he started to think of the role of a scientist and science (a bit late!), and how the gruffy conversations, in contrast to gell-mann's outlook, helped mlodinow shape his outlook on his work and life. he actually quit science and went into writing for tv!i'd have given it five stars if the language wouldn't wander off too far into the formulaic soap opera language ("i found the answers i sought about the nature of science and the scientist. but more than that, i discovered a new approach to life")."go look at an electron microscope photograph of an atom, okay? don’t just glance at it. it is very important that you examine it very closely. think about what it means.""okay.""and then answer this question. does it make your heart flutter?""does it make my heart flutter?""yes or no. it’s a yes or no question. no equations allowed.""all right, i’ll let you know.""don’t be dense. i don’t need to know. you need to know. this exam is self-graded. and it’s not the answer that counts, it’s what you do with the information."the history of the persian/greek wars, the war between athens' democracy and freedom against persia's slavery and tyranny, the first history book ever written, and, according to this translator, the greatest shaggydog story ever told (and he's right). it's hard to classify this as non-fiction - the gods still exist and have power, but contrary to (for example) the odyssey, they've taken a backseat. instead of mingling with the mortals, their power is indirect; all those who do wrong are correctly identified and punished:no sooner had they blinded euenius, however, than their livestock stopped giving birth and their soil turned similarly barren. when the appollonians asked  at dodona and delphi the reason for the calamity they were experiencing: that they had unjustly deprived euenius, the guardian of the sacred flock, of his sight.the oracles are always right - except when they're bribed and then themselves duly punished - their prophecies always come true, often in ironic ways, as known from oedipus.if you attack you will destroy a great empire.reading this is often like reading through an ancient wikipedia, since herodotus lists as many facts as he could collect. like wikipedia's links, every time herodotus mentions a new place or a thing he can't help but immediately list everything about it, with the consequence that this reads like a phylogeny of stories, with branches branching off other branches, as if you'd replace all links in the wikipedia by their respective articles' texts. you have to be careful when reading this, if you're tired when reading herodotus' frequent sidetracking will confuse you.funny enough, it takes herodotus about 6 or 7 of the 9 books until the "action" of the wars really starts; before that, he draws a picture of his world as complete and detailed as possible, knowing that this all will be lost and forgotten if not for his work. book 2 is all about egypt and what an amazing place it was, book 4 is about the scythians and their customs. darius, king of persia and first enemy of athens appears in book 3 - he dies in book 7, to be followed by xerxes, who subsequently raises the biggest army the world had ever seen, literally drinking rivers dry, and their subsequent bloody run-in with the spartans (here often lacedaemonians, after the region of which sparta was the capital) at thermopylae under leonidas (you know the comic and movie) and the subsequent defeat of the persian fleet by the greek fleet. in between there are numerous speeches, fights, customs, small stories, rapes and brutal murders, intrigues, bribes, lootings, valorous acts in battle, stupid decisions, hilarious events, and philosophies.herodotus himself has a strong voice and judges the stories as told to him by others; sometimes highly skeptical, sometimes blindly trusting (in which case holland's footnotes play the skeptic's part). by the way, the footnotes are numerous and extremely helpful in locating cross-references by herodotus (or these cases where herodotus says "i'll talk about this later" and then forgets all about it). in my ebook version with my font and size settings, the book ends at 68%, the rest is footnotes.recommended for: everyone.a relatively interesting treatise on "realpolitik" - how should a prince be if he wants to keep his power? machiavelli summarises quite a bit of italian history (which i know very little of) to show his points like "if you've got a social side it's going to cost you a lot of money, better make it look like you have one without actually paying anything". in parts it kept reminding me of modern politics, yet in other parts it's more historical document than anything ("the swiss run away when facing opponents of equal strength of mind!")the death of a famous actor during hamlet forms the central point of a narrative that sees more than three narrative strands interwoven from past to 20 years in the future, always returning to that single death. after the death, a new flu strain appears that kills its host in less than 2 days. it quickly spreads over earth and kills 99% of mankind, civilization disappears. if you're looking for more post-apocalyptic lit, this may not be your best bet - the book isn't very much concerned with the setting itself, it's not as dark as , for example. the flu has killed so many people that there's no competition for resources, the landscape is mostly empty.if you've read much post-apocalyptic fiction then you won't encounter anything novel here, the story of the prophet forms only a minor part of the book, variations of this "bad guy" have appeared before (fallout, walking dead etc.). narratives of the actor's lifetime, and his first wife's graphic novels, and how that actor's life is connected to the lives of a few others are more the focus. during the first half of the book the post-apocalypse felt even more like a tacked-on gimmick than an interesting device, which the second half fixed somewhat.i'm mostly reminded of ; just like the book of strange new things is science-fiction on the surface but a meditation on the end of a relationship, station eleven is post-apocalyptic on the surface but a story of regret, and how it accumulates.he found he was a man who repented almost everything, regrets crowding in around him like moths to a light. this was actually the main difference between twenty-one and fifty-one, he decided, the sheer volume of regret.that was depressing, so misantrophic - it's the story of ding village told from the unnamed dead narrator and its fall due to aids. it's a recent story - poorer regions of china hoped to improve their lives by selling their blood. the trade was quickly privatized, a lot of corners were cut, the blood buyers kept on re-using needles with the effect that hepatitis and hiv spread quickly (here's a good write-up from the economist).the story itself is told mostly with the dead child's grandfather as the main character, practically the only decent and non-greedy person in the entire village; everybody else (with the narrator's father not as main villain, but as biggest egoist) tries to make a quick buck, endlessly scheming to get more money, more things, more influence, more connections, always as egoistic as possible (for example, the party officials start a matchmaking service for dead people so that the dead won't have to live alone in the afterlife - in reality, it's to get dowries and matchmaking fees); everything falls apart, but everybody contributes their own small cut to the murder/suicide of the village. a tragedy of the commons where the resource is the village itself.grandfather as the only one keeps on trying to help everybody with the only consequence that everybody uses him for their own gain; he hasn't understood that there are no morals left (a bit like horváth's jugend ohne gott/the age of fish).  only at the very end does he finally make a definite step, yet then it's too late - he can tell the good news only to the coffins. a collection of good "longreads" essays mostly from the new yorker not about sherlock holmes (apart from the first essay) but more about obsession. a man obsessed with sherlock holmes, another with giant squid, another with robbing banks and breaking out of prisons - these essays are always amazingly well-written and clear structured. i'm just not the biggest fan of "true crime", about half of the essays would probably fit into that category.but how crazy is the story of toto constant? the last essay (available here) goes into much more detail of the cia involvement than the wikipedia article and made me glad i picked up the book.3.5the story of a few deep-sea divers stumbling upon a german u-boat at a depth of around ~200 feet close to new york, and their subsequent work on trying to identify it. the book is most riveting and claustrophobic in its  descriptions of the divers in the deep sea, trying to find their way around the dark inside the narrow busted-up submarine, the first half of the book is very strong in that. even though so many divers die during the story you can't help but want to join them in their quest...from there, it drifts off - there's a very unnecessary chapter describing what the author thinks the crew did before they embarked, for some reason there's of course not a single nazi on board, everybody's against hitler, the old cliches. it's an old question the children of the nazis asked back in the 60s and 70s: "if everyone was so anti-hitler, who voted for him?" there's a lot of soldier-worship in the last half, very american.his hair and his whole body were covered with cod-liver oil. he explained that, if, taken internally, it was salubrious, then it must likewise be good for the skin. also, as i was for myself, it turned his hair gold. this he felt made him look younger and more desirable. until this moment it had always puzzled me that fish did not bother with propinquity but, instead, conducted the business of procreation by remote control. i understood them now.autobiography of an extremely interesting, acerbic, witty, conflicted, dark personality, recommended for those interested in the "lower" strata of society. this is definitely no collection of "funny tales", even though at first glance it feels like one. there's a darker level here that only sometimes breaks out, especially towards the end ("it  would have been impossible to get through the kind of life that i have known without accumulating a vast unused stockpile of rage.  to me the motive  is self-evident. mass-murderers are simply people who have had enough.").i think books like this tickle a spot that nowadays post-apocalypse and zombies tickles - the kind of books that let you imagine your own life in a "new" spot, one without any society to speak of, free to do what you want to do, with a chance to "prove yourself" (a hunt for self-reliance?).the land breakers is the story of a new, small, faraway american settlement in the mountains of the 1780s. over a few years the reader follows the new settlers in the harsh conditions, as they try and make a living off the new land. all of them are trying to start a new life, but the harsh conditions take and take and rarely give. bears, panthers, snakes and diseases attack the settlers and take their stock, yet the settlers carry on.the narrator's language is direct, reminding me of blood meridian or butcher's crossing, often echoing the language of the book's inhabitants:“there are no birds here,” she said. “oh, yes,” he said, “the birds are here.” “i locked that door when i come in, and the smoke keeps birds out of the chimney.” “i feel their wings. listen to them fly?” she listened. “i hear the fire, that’s all.” “oh, no,” he said, knowing he would die.besides all the harshness, there's a peculiar brand of american optimism here - the kind that says "i need to start something new" and "there is no place for me in the old and established" (again: something which, to me, is nowadays  found in post-apoc fiction). it makes for great reading.you could say this is a mix of motulsky's intuitive biostatistics and goldacre's essays. the first half of statistics done wrong are plain english essays on various problems encountered in modern science related to statistics, problems which crop up again and again, such as the multiple comparison problem, over-reliance on p-values, etc. (similar to motulsky reinhart prefers 95% confidence intervals). the second half focuses more on reproducibility, statistical fishing etc.it's a very well-written short overview of the most egregious errors in science, so i think it's a good fit for working scientists interested in improving their statistical analyses. it won't make you a statistician, for that it's too short.a short novella about a relatively poor family living in an unfinished tower in buenos aires, their way of coping with the heat, observations on chileans vs. argentinian men, the daily life of the builders in the tower, and the family's preparation for new year's eve, all a bit dreamlike, like a hot saturday afternoon.ghosts also exist for some reason, their ethereal bodies being very useful for cooling wine, but mostly being taken for granted by the people they also make you commit suicide.are the thoughts that i am thinking as i look at this solid lump of fatty protein covered in blood vessels really made out of the same stuff? and the answer always comes back – they are – and the thought itself is too crazy, too incomprehensible, and i get on with the operation.what an interesting, human, and very honest book - marsh, nearly at the end of his career as a neurosurgeon, writes one chapter about something in his work that touched him - be it an operation that went wrong, or his fights with the hospital bureaucracy, his lifelong forays as a "western" doctor into the post-soviet ukraine, personal anecdotes on having seizures and fear of cancer in the own family, and there's so much regret:early the next morning i lay in bed thinking about the young woman i had operated on the previous week. she had had a tumour in her spinal cord, between the sixth and seventh cervical vertebrae, and – although i do not know why, since the operation had seemed to proceed uneventfully – she awoke from the operation paralysed down the right side of her body. i had probably tried to take out too much of the tumour. i must have been too sure of myself. i had been insufficiently fearful. but i knew that however bitter my regret, and however well the pineal operation went, nothing i could do would undo the damage that i had done to the young woman.some minor quibbles are the parts on nhs bureaucracy are probably due to his rose-colored glasses of the past ("in my day we wouldn't have allowed this!").if you like thinking about your own demise, like to think about how medical doctors tick inside, or are into neurology, this should be for you. i think i'm getting this as a birthday present for my soon-to-retire-from-medicine father.the basic story is a space opera - we have two "rich kids" representing both of their federations, and who've been locked in a rivalry for decades. one of them finds a way to quickly mine illyrion (very rare) in a most dangerous fashion and assembles a motley crew and tries to mine it. all the while his rival tries to stop him.on the outside it's a well-known story but there's a lot of "meta" in this to make it more interesting, such as katin's plan to write a novel about their adventure, and how much it resembles the quest for the holy grail; there is an interesting beginning of a philosophy of labor which builds up on marx's theory of alienation (in this case represented by some philosopher from "our" future) and "solves" it using technology; and some reflections on art. looking at delany's life it's like the mouse and katlin are both facets of delany's personality (but i'm just guessing). the large involvement of reading tarot cards in this particular society may be a product of the 70s.recommended for fans of meta-sfthe idea behind this is hilarious - a science-fiction pulp novel from an alternative timeline, written by an adolf hitler who emigrated to the united states in 1919 and became something of an underground star of the us science fiction scene, producing a fanzine, being involved in sf conventions etc.it's set in a future after the "ancients" (us) destroyed and irradiated most of the world with atomic bombs. it's all very "standard" fantasy/sf from there - the hero fenric jaggar, a true human with pure genes, arrives in the country of his ancestors, the "true humans", genetically pure etc. pp. (his father had been exiled due to "alleged warcrimes").  the kingdom is undermined by the dominators, mind-controlling "unpure" monsters, who are apparently a mix of jews and communists, who have been created by the atomic bombs. of course, jaggar turns out to be the chosen one, descendant of the pure kings, he's the only one who can wield the special weapon and he's the one who saves the kingdom etc. pp.it all reads like this:his face was set in a steel grimace of determination; in his blue eyes was a fierce and iron ecstasy. for an instant their eyes met and they were united in the comradely communion of battle, transfigured together in a red mist beyond time or fatigue. through the metal of the tank, the common weapon which they shared, their souls seemed to touch and merge for an instant in the greater communion that was the racial will. all this took place in the blink of an eye; their beings were not for an instant distracted from the sacred task.i tried to read it in an afternoon but it just gets too tiring, and i started to flip pages towards the last third.especially  hilarious are the introduction ("about the author") and the afterword ("those unfamiliar with the commercial science-fiction genre may be startled to learn that such pathological products are not that uncommon. the literature of science fiction abounds with stories of all-powerful phallic supermen, alien creatures rendered as fecal surrogates, penile totems, vaginal castration symbols (such as the monster with the many sucking mouths filled with razor-sharp teeth in swastika), subliminally homoerotic or even pederastic relationships, and the like.") i would have preferred to have the novel itself halved and the afterword doubled in length.it's a fun takedown of 60s/70s "preachy" fantasy and sf, like the gor novels, or even heinlein. i would pay good money to have bruno ganz reprise his role as adolf hitler and read a german translation of this, i would die laughing.here's ursula k. leguin's take on the book.what a strange little book.a collection of "fragments" centered around a pair of brothers. the first brother's path takes him to a nondescript war, which reads more like a fever nightmare without sense or purpose. soldiers march on without sense or purpose, people fall to the side and die, no-one knows what's going on, enemy soldiers are rarely encountered, soldiers are shot from seemingly nowhere, the skies are drenched in red.he loses his legs in what may or may not be a friendly fire incident, after which he returns home to his family and brother. his shaking implies shell-shock, and he subsequently loses his mind. the other brother is not a soldier (for some reason), his story is about the reactions of society to the war, the stupidity and craziness of the people supporting it, and the madness of it all.the descriptions of war - trenches, senseless shelling, fields filled with dead and wounded - made me think the author was a veteran of ww1, but the red laugh was published in 1904. what a strange book.i'm not sure why, but this left me completely cold.a range of essays - some are book reviews, which are a delight to read, very british in humor, witty, and usually fair. the only problem with them is that the book they are reviewing is usually outdated, or even out of print. the titular essay is a review of a book on a case of scientific fraud of the 70s (the book, again, is out of print). it surprised me how many similarities there are in this case to the recent acid-bath stem cell case of fraud, and i wonder how much of the psychology medawar mentioned can be applied in this case, too...the ones on philosophy of science seem to be almost 100% based on popper's work, these are usually rejections of inductivism and praise of falsification, there's even a short essay on why historicism is bad. i'm not sure why you should read these - they're more readable introductions to popper's work, but if you've read popper (or of popper) before, you won't find that much new in these essays.you can clearly see why gould wrote the introduction for this, this is where gould's writing is coming from (even though gould's essay style was much different, more american).the later essays are more personal, focusing on disease, a few good tips on being in a hospital, (from which i loved this quote:it is a rightly humiliating thought that, in spite of man's ability to reach the moon, etc., etc., , no one has yet designed a bedpan which is not physiologically inept, uncomfortable, and somewhat obscene.absolute truth - if you've ever been in a hospital and not allowed to get up, the design of any of these things hasn't changed in more than 50 years! here's something for your "disrupting start up"), and on religion. these are usually short, but playful, i'd read these on their own.recommended for: fans of scientific essays, philosophy of science pre-feyerabenda love letter to greece and greek thought, you can really feel how much hamilton was in love with greek. to her, the greeks were the first to bring "light" into the darkness of a world ruled by darkness and magic, in the form of rational thought. the greeks were the first to play - she compares them to the egyptians, to whom life was just suffering. their statues, their architecture, their poetry and writing was reduced down to the barest possible; if you've said it as precise as possible, then that's enough, no need for repetition or fancy allusions. a few playwrights are given their own chapters, in which they are compared to their "modern" partner (if one exists). to hamilton, greeks were the first and the last to be truly in love with knowledge and all possible viewpoints - she gives the example that there were plays making fun of their own side during the war, which received rave reviews and full theaters. can you imagine the same thing happen in the us nowadays ? of course, it feels like sometimes her image of greece is too positive, and the darker times of athens' hubris and fall are often quickly glossed over. then again, why focus on the ugly when you're writing a love letter?recommended for those people who'd like to know why many still see greek philosophy, thinking and art as important. her example is from ww1. but i switched for a modern example (the proof is easier to find: cough, cough). of course that comparison is unfair - athens was small and (relatively) homogeneous in thought, the us is a huge country full of different cultures and diametrically opposed political streams.good, detailed, and short overview of the hundred years' war between the uk and france (that one with jeanne d'arc and edward the black prince). my head started to swim a few times from all the names, the intricate and complicated patterns of relationships between these names and all the mini-battlefields and different motives. makes you wonder why there are still monarchists around - would they prefer to live in a world at constant war because yet another 16th degree cousin from the king's cook stumbled upon some soldiers and thinks he's entitled to the crown?especially the last chapter is good, in which the author traces all of the societal changes (like the fall of nobelty into poverty (most sons dead, paying for ransom of the few surviving ones, etc.), the absolutist concentration of french power onto the crown etc.) brought on by the war.assassinations! wars! intrigues! it's like reading a 120 pages summary of game of thrones.(the house of lancaster played a prominent role in this conflict, and the following war of the roses was the basis for game of thrones)a good overview of the basic "stories" of western mythology - mostly greek, some roman stories, and a little bit on norse mythology. it's a basic introduction - each "story" from ovid, homer, sophocles etc. gets a few pages of summary written in a lively and opinionated style (hamilton does not like hera). nothing more, nothing less.everything from büchner's earlier works is here, and in a much more mature and complete form: social injustice, critique of social structures and something like the "prussian mentality", mental illness , satire of the higher echelons of society, futility of life... it's a shame this was never completely finished.and so ends the month in which i tried to read everything from büchner, not exactly hard since there's so little left. woyzeck believes in a hollow earth and in a freemason conspiracy, he'd have loved youtubealternative title: weltschmerz is stupidvery short, fun play, on the surface it's a romantic comedy, underneath, it's making fun of pretty much everything. the king is an idiotic fool who sets his own mood by edicts ("let it be known that today i shall be happy", loose translation from me). leonce is a failed romantic, he tries to kill himself only to be stopped by his servant valerio, for which leonce berates him that it would have been such a beautiful suicide and now he ruined the moment. lena, who's an "honest" romantic, she doesn't try to kill herself, she just wants to run away. and of course, since this is making fun of german romanticism, all the improbable "romantic" things happen all of the time.i don't know how well this fares in english translations, half of the dialogue is amazing wortwitzrecommended for: people who think that werther was alrightchinese sf is something i've never read before, but it's a good start - like xiaolong's chief inspector cao's crime books this (in parts) explores the wounds of china's cultural revolution carried over into modern times. it's a good "mystery" - the story flows along nicely, i was enthralled with what's behind the three-body mmorpg, it's a relatively old idea executed amazingly, sadly the game disappears too quickly.now to the negative:- communication between humans and aliens is completely glossed over, both have for some reason translation machines that somehow figure out the other's language perfectly - read lem's his master's voice for a more pessimistic (imho realistic) take on communication with aliens- some of the human "bad guys" are more comic book villain than anything else- especially the last half is a huge info-dump, probably only attractive to people into what you can do with photons (and isn't it amazing?)- the description of science itself felt very weird to me, more like what i'd expect from new atheism. it's heavily implied that in a world with miracles science is impossible, which again implies that there's a forced dichotomy between both; in reality, back when people still believed in miracles, they had science too! like someone in the novel, you don't kill yourself because your models stopped working (in reality, they always stop working anyway)- the many small polite bits of chinese have been translated word-for-word into english; and in english, they just don't fit, they make for awkward conversations once you forget that this is chineseall in all, i'd recommend it to fans of sf who'd like to see their genre from a different anglea wonderful incomplete novella - the nature descriptions start it off like a "classic" german romantic novel, then it turns very modern in its description of the deteriorating mental status of lenz. it's great how the narration is in third person but is still influenced by lenz' mental status due to paranoid schizophrenia - for example, when he doesn't know what he's doing and loses his memory, the narration skips to afterwards. sadly we will never know what happens to lenz in the end as this is incomplete, but everything that needed to be said has been said.what a heavy, heavy book.published in english together with "verbrechen" as "crime and guilt"a short book of dark stories centered around the german justice system written by a defense attorney, supposedly a mix of fact and fiction. written in a sparse, non-judgmental, highly controlled style, he lists the facts of each case, and then towards the end the narrator appears as the lawyer who tries to sort out the case as much as possible. since this isn't tv crime many cases are never "solved" or really finished - for example, the first story of a masked band gang-raping a waitress ends in freedom for all of the accused: everybody wore a mask and dna-evidence did not exist yet, the victim cannot identify anyone for sure. the story ends with the grief of the victim's family, and the lawyer having lost his youthful innocence.it's very dark and certainly not for everyone, there are rarely happy ends here.written in a very simple style, here are some loose episodes told by a us sniper mostly stationed in iraq. i honestly wonder who thought this would make a good movie, there is not much depth, and the writing is clearly influenced by action movies (biggest cringe quote: "i managed to slip as well. my elbow flew out and landed straight on his face. a couple of times.").it often reminded me of jünger's storm of steel in his relatively "pro-war" message, like jünger kyle clearly enjoyed doing what he did. but unlike jünger, kyle has a weirdly inconsistent world-view, he sees himself as a patriot who defends his country, not for religious reasons (but then he gets the crusader cross tattooed anyway), yet iraqis defending their country/way of life are not soldiers, they are "savages", "drugged crazies" or "terrorists", never soldiers.it's all very american - there's no gray zone, the others are "evil", you're the "good guys", there is no moral ambiguity, life as an action movie.it makes little sense. works well as recruiting material, i guess?but: the parts detailing loss of colleagues/co-soldiers/brothers were touching.  read this on the train to amsterdam, but it's not really about amsterdam, more about growing older. the tone and atmosphere reminds me of hard rain falling or stoner, a melancholy caused by the inevitability of having to face what happened to your failed dreams when growing up. most stories focus on a group of friends from the netherlands, they want to be artists and despise the bourgeoisie, but it's the netherlands , it's small and focuses on the "respectable" people, the middle class. the group of friends grows older, no-one is really successful despite their high opinions of themselves, most of them have to work low-level office jobs to make ends meet (except for jupi, the last larrikin).everything went so differently from how we thought. that the world didn't care much about us - we all understood that a long time ago. but we still thought, for a while longer, that it was up to us to make the silent course of things take their course.highly recommended. i find the netherlands to be more confusing than japan. what's up with these huge ground-floor living room windows where you can see everything from everyone? and how come no-one is ever in these living rooms? and these living rooms are so spotless you could operate in there? is there a second "real" living room in the basement where people actually hang out? why are the flodders so great?a history of mathematics up to georg cantor, who died in 1918, the book itself was published in 1937. each chapter summarises the life of a mathematician (sometimes two, if their lives are intertwined), with about a quarter of each chapter being reserved for details on one or two discoveries.in tone it reminded be a lot of russell's history of western philosophy - there's the british humor and the strong opinions, some people may be put off by this. it's definitely no unbiased retelling of the history of mathematics (furthermore, about 80 years have passed. many of these stories may turned out to have been falsehoods by now ).some quotes to show the humor:as a matter of temperament some find the laplacian conception of an eternally stable solar system repeating the complicated cycle of its motions time after time for ever and ever as depressing as an endless nightmare. for these there is the recent comfort that the sun will probably explode some day as a nova. then stability will cease to trouble us, for we shall all quite suddenly become perfect gases.orcauchy's life and character affect us like poor don quixote's — we sometimes do not know whether to laugh or to cry, and compromise by swearing.orbut on the utterly imbecilic advice of his physician he began meddling in politics "to benefit his nervous system." if ever a more idiotic prescription was handed out by a doctor to a patient whose complaint he could not diagnose it has yet to be exhumed.some things i learned:- many famous mathematicians were ridiculous child prodigies in their youngest ages, gauss being the most famous example, discovering formulas at the age of 9, finishing disquisitiones arithmeticae at the age of 21 (!!!) in latin (!!!); william rowan hamilton spoke 13 languages by the time he was 13 years old (e. t. bell gets very angry about this "waste of time", he could have been doing mathematics!). it may make you look at your own life with a hint of having already wasted it.- others did terrible in traditional systems - like poincaré, who nearly failed the mathematical parts of his bachelor's degree and was only admitted because of his previous mathematical importance- funding of science changed a lot with the french revolution - before that, good mathematicians got their money from benevolent rulers, after that, they either had to give lessons or were (sometimes poorly) employed by universities- transfinite numbers are weird- and much more, it's a long bookthe biggest drawback, and here the book shows its age, is the very dry style of the mathematical parts, maybe i'm too spoiled by pop-science writing, maybe it's the age. sometimes, the mathematics is rather simple and you wonder why the author takes so much time to expand on these points (the age?), sometimes it's so short that you have to go look it up on wikipedia. these definitely take their time if you want to read them properly.but then again, to quote the author (on a different occasion):the choice of such phraseology is not merely stereotyped pedantry. there is a reason for its use, and careful writers mean exactly what they say when they assert that “we can find, etc” they mean that they can do what they say.recommended for: people into mathematics; people who think a book about mathematics is boring (you may want to skip or skim the mathematical parts, but it's your loss); fans of british humornot recommended for: people without patience, as it took me a few weeks to read this; people who need the truth and nothing but the boring truthin the future (now kind of alternative past?), there's just a soviet union and an allied sphere, and the two are still waging a cold war. an american scientist disappears during an explosion and re-appears as some kind of cyborg, saved by the soviets and brought back to the allied forces. of course they don't trust that it's actually him, it's a brain in a machine with one machine arm and one human arm carrying the correct fingerprints, how would you prove that this is actually the person who he says is?it starts off strongly in philip k dick territory with a bit of philosophy of the mind and existence, but then it becomes a fairly standard 50s/60s pulp sf book, it could have worked better if the final answer would have been left deliberately unclear. the ending describing all events from the soviet side is unnecessary.recommended for: golden age sf fansthis is the kind of book i'd like to write in 20 or 30 years. read hadrian's review, it's better than anything i could write.quite nice, an unknown narrator with a penchant for going off on tangents and a very dry humor tells a noir crime story set between two ambulance companies in vienna, with some murder, close escapes, confusing theories, set-ups, and of course, the "detective" gets beaten up constantly.this feels like it started out as an annotated edition of the iliad, and then ballooned into its own book, but it's still an entertaining read. the trojan war goes through the iliad (and later, a few other sources), treats the sack of troy as if it was a historic event (including characters - they probably did not have these names, but similar people probably did exist - "whether helen’s face launched a thousand ships or none, queens of the bronze age wielded great power and kings made war over marriage alliances."), and then goes from event to event - could this have happened this way? do we have evidence for similar events around that time? do we have archaeological evidence for similar wars happening at troy?an example:when the greeks sacked the city, they  put troy to the torch. archaeology discloses that a savage fire destroyed the settlement level known as troy vii (formerly called troy viia).  the inferno can be dated, according to the best estimate, sometime between 1230 and 1180 b.c., more likely between 1210 and 1180.orbronze age documents show that however brutal the sack of troy may have been, it would have conformed to the laws of war. cities that did not surrender would, if they were captured, be destroyed. this rule goes as far back as the first well-documented interstate conflict, the border wars between the two sumerian city-states of lagash and umma between 2500 and 2350 b.c.all the while strauss is a great narrator - often starting out with "now  imagine the scene", going into living detail how it could have been, then switching over to the primary text with comparison of secondary sources.the trojan war is a good introduction to the iliad and its events, it doesn't purport itself to be an academic work, in fact, the introduction explains most basic archaeology. if you've never had a university course in greek history or literature go for it.sometimes to procrastinate, i browse hacker news - a news community designed by y combinator, one of the big us startup hubs. as such, the community has developed into an almost religious cult-like thing around the "start-up life": "why don't you work 22 hours a day, why don't you sleep under your desk, you have to pivot/disrupt/boot-strap/pitch/iterate/, why don't you follow our hero zuckerberg/pg/thiel, you have to become great now" and more boring platitudes. the religious nature comes out in often-used terms like "angel investor" ( = someone who wastes their rich parents' money on an overvalued team, i.e., fantasy football with programmers).often a extreme fear of death comes out in these interviews and texts, now culminating in money not being focused on useless mobile apps, but on medical companies that treat death as a disease in the hopes of reversing or postponing your eventual demise (see for example here).this is where the denial of death comes in. becker summarizes otto rank's life work into a straightforward chain of argument, which goes a little bit like this: 1. man has a natural urge to heroism, someone who needs to justify their own existence as an object of value - this is due to his "evolutionary and organismic constitution" (nice hand-waving there).2. man is also the only animal that knows he is nothing but "food for worms", one slip in the shower and you're done for.3. this creates an inner conflict as you have the "god-like" inner heroism and the outer shell of a sickly creature, and both these points collide in your existence.4. the job of a child is to come to terms with this conflict by more or less learning to repress, and all adults have more or less repressed this conflict. this repression is in everyone, is healthy and expected. only when you can't handle the repression or when it becomes too extreme do you run into problems with your existence - becker/rank discuss this with the example of artists and "great", but problematic men like freud.5. along with the fear of death comes the fear of "too much life", when you know so much about your condition that it becomes too hard to bear:once you accept the truly desperate situation that man is in, you come to see not only that neurosis is normal, but that even psychotic failure represents only a little additional push in the routine stumbling along life's way. if repression makes an untenable life liveable, self-knowledge can entirely destroy it for some people.6. can we escape this dilemma? no. one solution to handle it better is to become a kierkegaard-ian "knight of faith", someone who has given the meaning of his/her life over to the creator (whoever/whatever that may be), someone who accepts death and life by becoming part of a bigger system. unlike the "gurus" of psychotherapy, of religion etc. (there's a nice, negative discussion of the overlap of 70s psychotherapy and religious movements), there is nothing you can do to fix or to transcend the conflict in your existence. "men are doomed to live in an overwhelmingly tragic and demonic world."he does make a fun case that christianity (the idealized christianity, not the power-structure with its own mountain of problems) has found a nice way to "sidestep" these problems:this is the most remarkable achievement of the christian world picture: that it could take slaves, cripples, imbeciles, the simple and the mighty, and make them all secure heroes, simply by taking a step back from the world into another dimension of things, the dimension called heaven. or we might better say that christianity took creature consciousness - the thing man most wanted to deny - and made it the very condition for his cosmic heroism.all of these arguments are straight out of the tradition of psycho-analysis; lots of interpretation, little supporting data. when becker/rank try to "update" freud's ideas on transference by saying it's not the oedipal conflict of the child, but the fear of either death or of too much living, then you can't help but wonder if they're just trying to replace "unprovable, logically sounding chain of arguments nr. 1" with "unprovable, logically sounding chain of arguments nr. 2".the problems of pure interpretation become apparent in the last chapter when becker tries to apply the above points on many mental diseases, and here scientific knowledge has long surpassed his points, and he (as he acknowledges) extremely oversimplifies. he says that depression is "just" a inability to cope with their fear of life and death, but by now we know that depression is caused by a whole spectrum of causes, from genetic predisposition, prolonged substance abuse, broken neuro-transmitters, vulnerability factors, social isolation etc. pp. please, don't go up to people with mental illness and try to explain their illness with these 40 years old ideas.my above points on "start up culture" can be interpreted from this chain of arguments - you have people who are aware of their death, but instead of repressing it or becoming part of something bigger than them, they fight death, something that's (according to becker/rank) not fight-able. their example: if you live to 900 years instead of 90, then each accident becomes so much more grave, the fear of life becomes more extreme. let's say you're supposed to die at 900, but you have a car accident and die at 80 - that means you "lost" 820 years. if you're supposed to die at 90 and you die at 80, you've lost "only" 10 years. what will happen is that people will worship security too much as each accident's impact will become extreme.bonus-quote:creation is a nightmare spectacular taking place on a planet that has been soaked for hundreds of millions of years in the blood of all its creatures. the soberest conclusion that we could make about what has actually been taking place on the planet for about three billion years is that it is being turned into a vast pit of fertilizer. but the sun distracts our attention, always baking the blood dry, making things grow over it, and with its warmth giving the hope that comes with the organism's comfort and expansiveness.recommended for: people who like to think about their lives.not recommended for: people who can't read critically, or who immediately model their lives after everything they read. these ideas are fun to entertain, but it would be unwise to immediately accept them.the "c. h. beck wissen" books are always well-written, concise, short and cheap (about 7€) introductions into their given theme, and i've read many of these thanks to train station bookshops (and their themes are wide-spread, too - i own one on zen-buddhism, one on suicide, one on ants, one on the history of capitalism and one on the thirty years' war).this book is no departure - on roughly 150 pages the author introduces answers to questions like "what is science?", "what is a theory?", "how does science progress?", "are social studies sciences?", "what are problems with different (i.e., mythological) world-views and is science 'superior'?" and ruminates a bit on how well theories can predict the future (tl;dr: eeeh) and on the dangers of "(metaphysical) naturalism", the belief that everything can be explained completely by science, a belief widespread in the scientific community.if you have read kuhn's the structure of scientific revolutions (which is of course cited) you might have heard of many of these things, but it's still a concise introduction you can read in an afternoon and i'd recommend it to any budding scientist, but be prepared for "dry" statements like "if the theory q concerning the part of reality w predicts that p will happen out of q, then it also predicts that q precedes p" (my rough translation from memory, i don't think an english translation of any "c.h. beck wissen" book exists).a huge collection of "weird" stories at about 1200 pages, highly recommended. some classic horror stories ranging from (to me) absolutely unknown belgian or nigerian authors, to well-known "classics" like borges, akatagawa, kafka, and a few modern writers like miéville, king (of course), barron, etc.some of the stories work well as twilight zone, x-files or outer limits episodes, and several have become episodes, but these are usually forgettable (who knew that outer limits episode with the scientist raising spacebugs that build a statue of the scientist's face was based on a george r. r. martin story?).my favorite stories and novellas in this are the dream-like ones, that put a rug under you and take you into someone's dream, you're not sure whether it's a nice dream of a nightmare, and just when you're getting used to it the story slips the rug from underneath you by simply ending.two novellas are worthy seeking out on their own: "tainaron: mail from another city" by leena krohn, a novella in letters from a person (?) who has moved to some kind of city (or giant organism) inhabited by insect-like people, or people turning into insects (?) and writes letters to her home."the other side of the mountain" by michel bernanos is a story of a shipwreck into a different dimension (maybe) in which the world changes all of its new inhabitants physically.recommended for: fans of something different?wonderful little novella about a professor who after an accident can't remember anything for longer than 80 minutes. the novella is narrated by the professor's new housekeeper who brings along her son - and since the professor is based on the mathematician paul erdős he loves kids (but he doesn't call them epsilons like erdős did, even though there are a few other erdős quotes here).the professor is an admirable teacher, so if you teach, i'd love if more people taught like this:he made me feel as though i were on an important mission, that i was the only one who could lead us out of this puzzle and find the correct answer.(of course it's  a great help if the teacher has no mid-term memory - the pupil can't become annoying no matter how long it takes until understanding is reached)recommended for: fans of maths, kind stories, erdősnot recommended for: people who don't want to see beautyat the city police station we found two officers but they were having a fist fight and were not available for inquiries.fun!i liked this one much more than wells' time machine - this book takes more time to properly develop, the world is a bit more fleshed out, characters are more human. some things that struck me particularly:1. since it's set in victorian england, communication between towns and cities is very poor, especially in the beginning of the invasion, when the next village doesn't know that their neighbors are all dead. that made me think of what would happen today with instant communication around the world.2. the protagonist is no hero, he's just there as a pure witness. most current stories focus on the "one hero who saves the day", this protagonist is more a bit of a coward (he could have saved the annoying priest, for example).3. the heatrays used by the aliens are invisible, something which a modern writer would never write! modern sf requires rays to be visible, even if they can't be in reality. it just has been ingrained in our collective imagination. other examples of this are gun-silencers that are completely silent, flashbangs that don't burn, sound in space, etc.4. there are a few things illogical - the ending (or solution) is rather weird, and in its abruptness reminded me a lot of the ending of the movie signs. you'd think they would have worn closed suits to survive earth's viruses - and how does human blood as their food work? you probably can't survive on alien meat, except if you share common ancestors, which is highly unlikely with mars furthermore, aliens seem to favor the uk for some reason (a tradition that has been happily continued in dr. who), but that could be just due to the little overview of the protagonist.anyway, nice proto-sf, good to see where the genre comes from.this is good - wagner is trying to answer the question of how nature innovates beyond "randomly mutating around", here he summarizes a life's work (so far) of the models his research group has built. he explains it for metabolic networks, for protein interaction networks, and more.he uses the image of borges' library of babel, except that each book is a station in the library of all possible connected protein interaction networks (most of them make no sense, some of them do), and these books are connected by single changes. each reader is an individual of a population, and if you take the wrong step (mutation) and get a book without sense, you die.the interesting thing is that if you map these libraries for the organisms where there's data like e. coli or yeast, you can take random walks through there using programs. and what they found is that you can take very long walks (up to 80% of the library) through the library, ending up in very different networks that still produce the same outcome. that way, a large part of the library, and with that a large part of variation, is explored! interestingly, you can do the same with human-created logical circuits, and you get very, very similar results. for biologists reading this book especially the beginning might be slow as he uses many examples from undergrad biology like the lac-operon, hox genes, and more. you might want to check out his publications instead: http://www.ieu.uzh.ch/wagner/publications.htmlespecially "140. wagner, a. (2013) genotype networks and evolutionary innovations in biological systems. in handbook of systems biology. eds: walhout, a.j.m., vidal, m., dekker, j., academic press, london, p 251-264. " looks good, figure 13.2 is also in the book. nice of him to provide reprints for most of his work!does this book solve the question of how nature comes up with innovations? it certainly is a great "viewpoint" and deserves more thought (from me, too).recommended for: those interested in life who like to see things from a different angle.p.s.: looking around a bit for more reviews on the web, it seems there's a quite large group of people who are outraged by wagner's few quips about creationists. americans are weird.like all "classic" sf, this one hasn't really aged well - you know the story from other media, you don't particularly care for anyone in the story, plus it's weirdly short, as if it was written with the deadline being in the next two days. there's a nice layer of criticism of victorian society which reminded me a bit of flatland.p.s. pro-tip: if you write a time travel story and you don't want to research anything, put the setting entirely into the future, problem solved!p.p.s.: my kindle edition has definitions for the few "old" english words, "recondite" (adjective) is the very first definition, it means "difficult" or "obscure". it's the only word i know of that hasn't started as an autological word, but rather became one over time!(personal contender for one of the most beautiful covers published in last few years)three thirds make one book - the personal grief of a woman who's lost her father, her efforts to train her own goshawk, and both strands are juxtaposed to the failed efforts of  to train his own goshawk 50 years earlier (the guy who wrote the amazing ). the grief is heartbreaking and, in its openness, reminded me of a grief observed - similarly, her wayward efforts (just like with cricket there's an entire world of obscure vocabulary connected with raising and keeping a hawk). i didn't know there are people who spend their days just sitting in their living room with a gigantic hawk on their arm. you'd imagine conan doing that, not historians from england. the juxtaposition with white's life doesn't always work out - and sometimes the "taming" of the hawk doesn't lead to much of a story, you think "so this is where the book ends" and yet another chapter starts.now i want a hawk. of course that's illegal in australia. of course.the bulk of this book is a dialogue between cronin and herzog - or rather, cronin gives a theme and herzog delivers a small essay. the later parts are a few collected poems of herzog, an autobiographical fragment of traveling through germany, and a few essays on herzog.the dialogue goes through herzog's entire life and work up until ~2013, focusing mostly on his movies, especially his philosophy of his work. what impressed me most about this is how much herzog is on fire for his work, he never compromises anything, with a certain pride to commit crimes in order to make his movies possible (forging documents, stealing cameras, a few break-ins, planned murders (understandable with kinsi) etc.). i wish i would burn just half as much as that man.the dialogue is full of great quotes on the theme herzog vs. the world full of humor and warmth, here two examples:parents these days even send their children to the sandpit with a helmet. the whole thing is repulsive. i would never trust in a man who has had multiple helmets by the age of five.oryou would get me watching wrestlemania before you could drag me into a theatre. i'm much more comfortable with the vulgarity of that crowd. there is more honesty in wrestlemania's fakery than in traditional theatre.or on one of herzog's common themes, mankind's relationship with the indifferent universe:the overwhelming quality of the universe is monumental indifference and lack of order. it's a statistical improbability we're even on the plant, this miniscule speck surrounded by a myriad of uninhabitable, hostile and lethal stars that boil in nuclear rage. look at the solar system from a satellite and see how utterly insignificant earth looks. the universe couldn't care less about us, and i hope i never have to call upon it for asssistance. the dialogue is filled to the brim with amazing anecdotes, some of which you may have heard already (the shoe-eating, the many quarrels with klaus kinski including that one time the local natives offered to murder kinski, all the crimes committed to get the movie done...), highly recommended. if you're not a fan of herzog's movies or you haven't seen them, i'm pretty sure some parts will drag as you won't really know what he's talking about.recommended for: those interested in impressive people, fans of herzog,not recommended for: tax officialsthis must be my least favorite pkd novel - he shines best in craziness, in distrust of one's mind and perception of the world, when reality is moved just a tiny little bit to the side (the german word for crazy, "verrückt", literally means "a little bit moved to the side", like a piece of furniture).this one's a bit of a more "conservative" sf novel born out of the cold war, we have most of mankind living underground after world war 3, (minor spoiler which is revealed in the second chapter or so) but the war has been over for a few years, only advertising men rule the world, creating simulacras and movies to keep the underground population believing in a war so they can keep producing robots for the personal armies of the advertising men (i think? it's revealed that these men have huge armies, but it's quickly established that these armies rarely fight - so what's the point in having 99% of mankind keep on producing robots?).the premise is a bit too black/white for me, too obvious criticisms of a media society, and the story just drags along until it suddenly ends out of the blue without any real solution, as if dick hit some deadline and just abandoned the story there. the only interesting character is lantano, but sadly he has very little "screen time".recommended for: fans of pkd who desperately need to have read every novelnot recommended for: the restwhen i was about 15 or 16, i bought quarantine ii: road warrior for my 33 mhz gaming beast pc , with box art hinting that i should not have been allowed to buy that game at that time:you play a taxi driver in a dystopian "escape from l.a."-like future in which you can roast pedestrians with your taxi's in-built flame-thrower with impunity (again, not really suited for a 15 year old). this "dystopian future without morals or structure but with lots of blood" seems to have been a big thing in the 90s: see judge dredd, robocop, rogue trooper, (in fact, most of the 2000 ad characters), it's also an aspect in some older gibson books.womack's dryco novels (and his i think unrelated but imho best "random acts of senseless violence") are set in a very similar world - it's america of the not-so-distant future, society kind of works but has mostly collapsed, mega-corporations run the place more than politicians, and due to various reasons the law isn't exactly enforced, i.e., most of the characters are under threat of death and constantly kill themselves, without anybody blinking an eye. on most pages random bystanders die.the first one, ambient, was a bit too much over the top for me (for example, "board room meetings" are matches to the death by a companies' champion against the other companies' champions, and the losing company has its ceo's head cut off while the companies' ownership is being transferred to the winner). this third one, hearthen, is a bit less extreme because it acts as a bit of a prequel - it's set before dryco became the company running the usa, with some events of the first book (such as the ai, or ambient's "big bad guy") being nicely foreshadowed. therefore, most events described aren't that extreme as in the first one (but the great ambients don't feature as much as in the first one).the basic story is that dryco is looking for a messiah so it can use him for their company pr, finds one who performs jesus-like miracles and tries to hire him, he mostly goes along with it (without any real motivation except "my god(s) told me to"), there's a relatively believable "good" female main character, yet the story often just bungles around without really progressing. i guess it's good as a part of the series but doesn't work on its own, yet i liked the "less extreme"/"more quiet" aspects of it. it had a turbo button to slow down to 16 mhz (else theme park would run too fast)this book works in two ways - the first one being the "memoirs" of someone somewhere on the autism spectrum who has a wife with the patience of several saints, the second way being some kind of self-help book for people with similar problems. the memoirs suffer (to me) from a bit of too much the cliche americanisms - praying to god in minor situations, discussing christmas decorations (if a neighbor of mine would make joke-bets about how long i keep up christmas decorations, i'd burn down his fake house and move to a place with normal people), being jealous of other people's too perfect plastic existences (defined as an apparently constantly baking housewife and a successful husband), salesman talk etc. the second one works if you have problems with your relationship due to your autism spectrum, which (i hope) is quite specific... possibly too specific for me.very engagingly written story of belgium's king leopold ii's quest for his own personal colony, his very shrewd politics to create one in the yet unmapped congo, the men who made the discoveries possible, the many atrocities committed to build and retain the colony (the author estimates the number of deaths in the colony due to murder, slavery, and disease to 10,000,000 , so many people died that belgian officials worried there may not be enough workers in the future), the lives of the impressive men and women who tried to stop the colony, and the echoes of all of this into recent times (did you know that the first prime minister of the congo was assassinated with support by belgium and the us? see here). i kept being reminded of today's politics, so much runs identical - if you want your "sinister" project to be supported by other nations, just say it's for humanitarian reasons (leopold: "i just try to uplift these poor africans from poverty!"; bush: "i just try to liberate these poor iraqis!"), but also make sure that you involve other powerful nations in your wrongdoings (hochschild shows nicely how some other nations (germany, britain) committed similar atrocities at the same time, but because no-one except belgians was financially involved in the congo, it was "safe" for other countries to criticize the belgians for their conduct in the congo.).when damaging information is released about your "project", immediately release countering information, and try to twist as much as possible if you have the chance (recent example), just like leopold ii managed to release "summaries" of official state documents summarising the murders to journalists, but the "summaries" contradicted the actual reports. just like today, journalists printed the summary, who has time to read the actual thing? by the time the report was actually read the damage was done, the story was out and "accepted".since this is "narrative" history it's partially written more like a novel than a non-fiction book, with tinges of humor and vivid descriptions of events, may not be everyone's cup of tea. a contested number since there was no paperwork, no-one knew how many people lived in the congo before, the belgians did not keep track of how many people they killed, no-one kept track of the spread of disease etc.a relatively short remembrance of a butler who lived for his craft towards the end of his life. while he's on the way to meet a former female colleague he realises that he has been more than blind towards her interest... it's hard to describe how well ishiguro understates his reactions to her, and it's up to the reader to realise what's going on. it reminded me of (and if you're a man, it will remind you too) of dialogues in your youth like this one:her: sooo (short pause, finger in hair and a twirl) what are you doing this weekend?you: hmm not much. maybe tv?her: i don't have much planned either!you: huh. well, um, enjoy, i have to go now.and then 10 years later this memory suddenly hits you out of nowhere and you still have to groan.anyway, the book is much more than that - there is some hilarity ensuing from too much britishness (the 23-year old godson of the manor's lord is to marry soon - the father himself never explained "the birds and the bees", and is too shy to do it. he asks the godfather, who then turns out to be too shy, too, and the godfather asks the butler in a hilariously awkward scene, who does his best to try and bring up that particular topic of discussion), there is much about britain's appeasement politics in the 20s and 30s, and you can't help but marvel how well this all is constructed.the first quarter or so is dry (lots of "philosophy of butlering") but it sets up the character - so if you're finding yourself bored, keep on working, it will be worth it in the end.relatively interesting autobiography of vonnegut's son developing schizophrenia, while being part of the 70s counter-culture - realistic (albeit tiring) rambling of all the things that went through his head, and interesting reactions of his surroundings (something like "mental illness is a myth perpetuated by the man to keep us down"). it does get boring in endless descriptions of those people around him.recommended for: those interested in what happens to people developing a mental illness a collection of goldacre's articles, the majority from the guardian. they're usually concerned with "bad science", i.e., politicians who abuse statistics in order to support their leanings, quacks who're abusing stats to peddle their wares, (tabloid) newspapers who are filling their frontpages with exaggeration.most of these articles are reactions to uk media and politics, so non-british readers may not get as much out of this book as british (i always had this vague notion that british tabloids are incredibly terrible - but this was eye-opening). it's still a good introduction in how to think about science in popular communication, and a start on how to critically check their claims, but you won't learn statistics.towards the end there's a bit of unnecessary "stuff" (in a chapter called "stuff") that doesn't fit the rest of the book and feels "tacked on" - like an introduction to a train's book.interestingly goldacre added an essay he wrote as a just-finished med undergrad, at the young age of 23. that's very brave - i can't even get myself to read my writings from one week ago without cringing.what a wonderful book - in parts science-fiction with alien contact, in parts the history of a couple drifting apart, in parts the history of religious and spiritual development of a priest. (disclaimer: i'm not religious at all)nothing (except maybe the events on earth) is overdone, the book is earnest; in the beginning, when all is still well, the email-like dialogues between peter, on planet oasis, and his wife bea back on earth border on the sugary sweet, which is what i'm used to from happy christian couples, during the course of the novel both start to doubt their beliefs, and the language in the mails becomes dissonant, she is truthful, he still hides behind bible quotes (which by the way, mirrors my experience with the few people i know who are religious from birth - if things get very hard, there's a crisis of faith). she has a crisis, he has a crisis of a different kind, it's honest.the aliens most reminded me of lem's aliens, they're either impossible to understand or everything is a misunderstanding -in fact, their interest in christianity is entirely founded on a misunderstanding of english- even the rain on the planet with its unexplainable movements reminded me of solaris' ocean. the private company sending everyone to the planet makes sense - earth-water costs $50 per bottle and is deducted from the salary, since transport is expensive. workers are strange and remind me of "drones", but that is the psychological profile needed if you're stuck on another planet on your own. there is no "evil" in the company, just straightforward capitalism.i'm currently stuck in another country waiting for a visa, while my fiancée is a 20 hour plane ride away that i can't take anyway, since there's an 8 hour time difference we communicate mostly in writing, so the book struck a totally unexpected chord with me. i wouldn't know who to recommend it to, except myself, right now.hm, to me, a mixed baggood things:- from reviews, i thought this would be violence-porn in ww2, pleasantly, the majority of the book is about a lost love made impossible by circumstances and lies, and that story is good- the changes in time and place are pulled off very well, never did i get disorientedbad things:- everybody *always* speaks in the same language about "life's grand truths", and in doing so most people sound like the same guy. example, a brewery truck driver:it's like life, isn't it? you think you'll outrun it, that you're better than it, but it makes a fool of you every time. it runs you into the ground and steams off whistling away  these sentences, and the story around it, gives the book an unnecessary sentimental air. it feels a bit like the author is trying to manipulate your emotions while you're fully aware of it, like waking up during narcosis.meh things:- is there any australian book that doesn't gush over the concept of "mateship"?easily one of the more unique books i've read in my life. it could easily have been a shorter, drier treatise of a philosophy on how to live, approaching many "solutions" only to reject them - but lindsay buried that in a strange, meandering, sometimes boring story of a man from earth traveling a distant and strange planet in five days, losing his bodily shape, gaining limbs, interacting with people of various countries and dispositions, absorbing people, killing people, being mind-controlled, meeting various gods or demiurges, etc. pp.it's certainly not an easy book - not easy to read, not easy to interpret - but i think you owe it to yourself to give this a chance.very interesting collection of essays - most of them start out as book reviews (for example, on teller's autobiography, or dennett's breaking the spell), but since the new york review of books lets you write 4000 to 5000 words, dyson often uses the book review as a starting point to philosophize about the book's field, the history of the field, his ideas and viewpoints, the relationship between the field and society, the possibility of evil, etc. the essays are grouped into three parts - war and science's part in the second world war, the history of science (with newton, feynman, teller etc.) and religion. religion is my least favorite part, possibly because my interest into religion is so low. i especially like dyson's penchant to connect seemingly unconnected fields, and how quick he starts to "think big" without any fear of looking ridiculous (remember the dyson sphere?) - i'm a fan of the concept of using genetically modified trees to terraform the inside of asteroids. i admire scientists who do not develop a "tunnel view" of their chosen field and stay interested in everything.now i got about 20 more books to read...a bit of a cheat in the title, this isn't really a concise and structured history but a posthumous collection of essays, speeches, newspaper articles, reviews, chronologically sorted by subject matter.  you have to love it when the introduction already has a quote like "klassikerverehrung  eine spezialität des deutschen untertanen-staates" (hard to translate: the worship of classic novels is a specialty of the german underling-state).it starts with some "general" essays on german literature like on the role of jews in german literature or the "heart" in german writing, and then iterates over authors, starting with walther von der vogelweide and ending with a review of süskind's das parfum. there's a bit of a focus is on reich-ranicki's temporaries, post ww2 literature, gdr literature - koeppen, grass, kästner, weiss, dürrenmatt etc., but it's not like the earlier history in the form of goethe, lessing, hölderlin, heine, hesse etc. is neglected. (the essay on kraus made me laugh - reich-ranicki didn't like kraus' constant need to be some kind of messiah/prophet for his "disciples" without a hint of self-irony, no wonder franzen loves kraus so much! they're the same person!) there's so much previously unknown (to me) to discover here (alfred polgar, eva demski, jureck becker, ulla hahn, ingeborg bachmann, sarah kirsch, erich fried...), and for that i'm thankful. all essays and reviews are honest - bad writing is dragged to the light, nonsensical formulations by greats like schiller are logically analyzed and ripped apart, love letters are written to good writing (and sometimes, like in jelinek's essay, even bad writing is praised if the power behind becomes obvious).it's a good, but not really coherent intro to german literature with a slight focus on the modern. if you're into that, go for it!so i read this book.it was written in short sentences, each on its own paragraph.about a guy who walks around chicago. doing not much, except being cooky/lolrandom about various things.the book is a pile of things.a pile of things, piling more but only ever making one pile.a life.not something to get over.but something to overlook, to forget about.yes!once, i spent a summer working in a wine bottling factory in my hometown in germany. my job was to stand next to a machine which filled plastic bags with cheap, mixed white wine, and a conveyor belt put these bags into boxes. australians call these bags affectionately "goon bags". my task was to put the filled boxes on pallets. i worked with a man about 30 years my senior - he had worked in that factory for more than 20 years, the last 10 years on that machine. with my 19 years, in a state that constantly seeks the new, that man was my nightmare personified, and i could not understand how he could stand this life. my perception of his life as a nightmare wasn't improved by the fact that his first action, every morning, was to take the first filled goon bag. he drank one bag per shift. i once asked him half-jokingly what his future plans were - he answered: "i have only 15 years to go, then i can retire!" that answer gave me a minor panic attack. i soon lived in his world: i don't know if you've ever worked in a factory, but once you're fully in a mindless repetitive task, time ceases to exist. after 2 weeks of work, 8 hour shifts were over in seconds, and at home i was too tired to stop the flow of seconds. a month of this work felt like 3 minutes, and i could understand how the man could treat 15 years so flippantly; to him, 15 years are half an hour.this book transported me right back into that mindset: "i still have time", the lie based on the vague hope that something might happen to you, while the days are just slipping away. the k.-like passivity i so easily fall into, based on the lie that things happen to me, i don't have to make them happen. this book gave me a minor panic attack.recommended for: people who think there's still time, this book is a warning.a bunch of people are stuck in a labyrinth, each in their own room, only able to communicate via a thread in a forum (internet! so modern!). they all discover bits and pieces of the labyrinth around them, exchange information, but ultimately, not much ever happens, it just goes nowhere.i didn't care for anyone, the philosophical parts about the helmet of horror were beyond boring (example:ariadnethe separator labyrinth is the most important part of the helmet of horror. it’s the place where everything else is produced out of nothing, that is, the place where the stream of impressions arises. and it’s also the place where the past, the present and the future are separated. the past moves upwards, the future moves downwards, and the present, in the form of the stream of impressions, falls on to the outer surface of the frontal net, generating the cycle’s passionate desire to recur, so that it becomes a kind of perpetuum mobilemonstradamushang on a moment. the bubbles of hope are just another state of past, right?etc. pp., are you still awake?)anyway, absolutely not my cup of tea.giving up on this after 50% - have to return my copy to the library. didn't want to finish it, bored me to tears. better name: 'data munging with python's pandas and numpy'it focuses heavily on pandas and the myriad of things you can do with a dataframe. very often the examples are extremely specific, yet the example data is contrived, like "here's this rather specific case in which you want to average a subset of a column in a table, but only those cases where the person linked to the index of that column has the astrological sign pisces", and about 5 minutes later, i already forgot how the author did it. still a nice introduction to pandas, if you want to know everything there is about the library (and when do you ever have to do that?).roughly 100 years after the start of the first world war, jünger's autobiographical novel summarizing his experience 1914-1918 on the western front still makes for interesting reading.having just read the odyssey i couldn't help but think that some god must have been with him like athena was with odysseus - bullets constantly kill everyone around him, people are torn to shreds, he is wounded about 15 or 16 times, most of these wounds are just minor but close (several times bullets enter his head, but he's lucky enough that these bullets never penetrate his skull). and it's not like he's evading the war - if he doesn't lie in his recollections, then he's at the forefront of every battle, always overtaking his own people. he makes die hard movies look plausible.two really weird aspects about the book:1) he is a huge fan of wartime heroism - he doesn't care for why or what he fights, as long as he can prove his "ritterlichkeit", his chivalry. if he dies, so be it; it would be an honour to die on the battle-field (one is reminded of mishima). in fact lots of people in this book die for absolutely nothing (one example are his "boys", the lower ranks who have to do his minor tasks for him - several of them die getting his food).2) (this one might be lost in translation if you don't read the german original) he often uses the language of sports to describe the war, which feels rather strange when he talks about his friends being blown up in the words that i know only from tennis. storming the enemy's trenches is a "short, sports-like sensation" - injured soldiers are "ausgeschieden" (eliminated? but that word is used in death,too) , which nowadays is only used for sportsmen who're forced to leave the competition due to external circumstances  - he's injured during a huge battle, yet he's sad about leaving the battlefield in this "interesting moment". maybe this is a product from the fact that he doesn't shy back from his own monstrosity - there are several scenes in the book in which he's just a twitch away from executing unarmed enemies; he often shoots fleeing soldiers in the back. a modern iraq veteran writing about his war like this would be branded a psychopath (yet he might not be lying).the jünger wikipedia article makes for good reading, too - he was against national socialism to the point that he had connections to the stauffenberg bomb plot. only his famous in stahlgewittern and his extremely high-level merits saved him from being executed. interestingly, he later experimented with many drugs and became a good friend of albert hofmann, the discoverer of lsd. it's the last thing i expected from a far-right conservative war hero.recommended for: those interested in history or war, this year's centennial is a good chance to read this.not recommended for: the squeamish, there's blood, brains and severed body pieces on practically every page.i'm not the target audience for this: a collection of 'letters' to an unnamed, fictitious young person with an interest in science, trying to entice that person to start a career in science (since 'you are needed'). i've already got a bit of a career in science, i don't need chapters telling me how a theory is formed. the various facts about different ant colonies are quite inspiring, though.one note: it's often said that wilson doesn't like maths and tells other people they don't need it, but here the position is a bit better fleshed out, and more agreeable: 1) he only talks about algebra as used for model building and in theoretical biology, he never mentions statistics at all (which you'll need, dear student).2) he correctly says that the time investment into learning all the maths is better invested elsewhere if you got diverging interests - you can always find a collaborator who's better at mathematics than you are. the last two chapters, in which wilson describes how theories are developed and tested using stories from his life, show that; he always lists collaborators who built the models based on his data.in the end, it seems he says 'you don't need maths' as a bit of 'propaganda', since there are prospective scientists who end up in different careers out of a fear of mathematics.recommended for: high school students/undergrads who are looking for something to do with their liveswonderfully melancholic, a collection of short stories and one eponymous novella.each story is somehow connected to biology, and the history of biology - the novella deals with a doctor trying to handle a typhus epidemic plaguing irish immigrants in canada, other stories deal with famous biologists, mendel, darwin, wallace and more appear. but, it's not a book of stories about science - each story has at its core a failed or failing relationship, be it between man and woman, or between father and daughters, or in between relatives, or travelling companions. luckily, it's not an overwhelming, "in your face" sadness; it sneaks up on you while you're reading and hits you over the heart.leave it to a german to start a revolution over two horses.pop-history?a fun quick romp through 1000 years of byzantine culture, covering the split of the roman empire into two, the rise of christianity, it's split into the orthodox and the catholic part, the crusades, the dark ages and how the byzantine empire 'rescued' greek culture by hiding it away from the european turmoil. not without humour, you can see the author's background in podcasting, with a good (verbal) flow.sadly 300-odd pages isn't enough for 1000 years.layers on layers on layers of different conspiracy groups who only know little of each other, grasping at straws in the dark, being based in ancient history or not.what made the layers of communication even better was the fact that my copy was from my uni's library, and went through at least 3 annotators - the first one (a woman, i think) being straight-forward and just summarizing most scenes; the second one, again a woman, either analyzing a bit deeper or mocking the first one's summary (the fact that both had nearly identical handwriting made it harder ), the third one, obviously a man, trying to summarize with frantic and illegibible hand-writing what's going on. i had a feeling he was trying to communicate with someone.as a german it was fun to see the thurn and taxis being a central element of the backstory. most germans know glora von thurn and taxis - she's a far right conservative, anti-abortion, ridiculously rich source of fun, here's her most famous quote:afrika hat probleme nicht wegen fehlender verhütung. da sterben die leute an aids, weil sie zu viel schnackseln. der schwarze schnackselt gerne.uttered at a talkshow about 10 years ago, translated: "africa doesn't have problems because of missing contraception. the people there die of aids, because they have too much sex. the black man likes to have sex." she's also against giving condoms to teenagers, she'd rather they play tennis (her words). ("do you want to go... all the way this weekend? - yeah, i think it's time! we're good enough for the county tournament!")2008 she published a rap-song about.... her family? hard to say. here's the video in its confusing lipsynced glory. people say that if you play that song on loop while reading the book, yahweh's true name will appear to you.recommended for: fans of illuminatus!, foucault's pendulum, post-modernism, 60s counter-culture, alternative mail systems, funnot recommended for: people who tattoo symbols from books on their arms, i've seen enough muted post-hornsthe sense of loss this book emanates kills you. starting around 1890 and ending in 1939, this is something of a memoir of stefan zweig, one of the most famous german-language austrian writers of the early 20th century. but it's less about zweig himself than about the artistic world of vienna and paris before the first world war. both had a brimming high culture that, if zweig doesn't call on too much hyperbole, i haven't encountered once in my life. both cultures never seem to have recovered from both world wars - i've been to vienna and was greeted by arrogance; i've been to paris and was greeted by the smell of asparagus (rs4481887 (a;a) says hello). maybe it takes a few hundred years more?several times the book surprised me - did you know that before 1914, you didn't need a passport for anything? zweig travelled to the us and to india without one; and, to kill some time, found 5 different jobs open to anyone; no-one had visa or passports back then, it wasn't needed. i also didn't know that austrian women around 1900 lived extremely strict lives; no woman was allowed to know about her sexuality, it was the husband's job during the wedding night to, um, give a crash-course. (interesting sidenote: zweig firmly believed that prostitution went down after these strict rules disappeared. i'm skeptical.)i was also surprised to learn in what an environment zweig grew up in: his circle of adolescent friends all started to publish in literary magazines around 17, 18 years old - all of them constantly writing and bouncing ideas off each other, meeting with such famous writers as hoffmansthal and more. in fact it's amazing what famous names show up in this book, many names of the greatest artists appear. some of those were zweig's friends, some of them colleagues, all of them described in several scenes: theodor herzl, rudolf steiner, romain rolland (he was of particular importance to zweig and appears often), rilke (especially fun descriptions of him - somehow comically inept at life), yeats, gorky, walter rathenau (!!), karl haushofer, emile verhaeren, ignaz seipel, james joyce, h.g. wells, and many many more.surprising too that zweig, after he enrolled in university, immediately took three years off. you can't do that anymore - universities have lost their role of creating "citizens", now universities are concerned with churning out humankapital in the duty of neoliberalism and capitalism (i'm just jealous). it's also fun to know that the burschenschaften and verbindungen back then were the same idiotic far-right weirdos they are now (except that nowadays, most of them stopped fencing with "real" weapons - the visible facial scar has disappeared from germany's intelligentsia).zweig saw himself as a citizen of the world first, and much of this book is concerned with the european project and the slow death of the "weltgewissen" (the world's conscience). the parts in which both world wars start are heart-breaking, and the strongest of the book; zweig sees the suffering, and suffers himself. he knew that we as human can only get past the violence if we unite. maybe now my generation has a chance again - humans from all countries are connected to each other, in fact, i'd wager that most of my friends grew up in the internet first and in their country second.recommended for: people who see themselves as citizens of the world. european politicians. reminded me a lot of cosmic bandidos, the larger-than-life characters, the movie-dialogues, but cosmic bandidos is more fun, the monkey wrench gang often gets bogged down in the extremely detailed descriptions of various destructive acts - ever wondered how to stop engines of various 1960s and 1970s earth-movers, and need to have every step described to you in detail? look no further! recommended for: fans of counter-culturesit's a bit hard to give this a rating - it's a primary text that survived a few thousand years, who am i to summarize that in 1 to 5 stars? the relatively new translation (i think 1996) makes the old text easily readable at the loss of poetry, one example:those men who court your wife and waste your goods?i have a feeling some will splatter your ample floors with all their blood and brains.it's great fun reading - first telemachus, then odysseus undergo all kinds of danger, death surrounds them -  people are killed in brutal ways left and right - gods meddle in every aspect of the mortals' lives, pain is everywhere. that's one of the biggest takeaways to me, how pain and despair are inevitable, but which are needed to shape you into the person you are, exemplified in how odysseus introduces himself towards the end:i come from roamer-town, my home's a famous place,my father's unsparing, son of old king pain,and my name's man of strife...recommended for:- people who think classics are boring and would like to be converted, this translation is a good starting point.- fans of "meta" narratives; there are numerous allusions to other greek plays, characters and mythology.- fans of violence.not recommended for:- people who need a clear-cut black and white "good" hero, that doesn't seem to exist in greek fiction anywaybonus quote:but now i cleared my mind of circe's orders -cramping my style, urging me not to arm at all.so that's where that comes fromi'm a dime a dozen, and so are you!it's rather hard to write anything insightful about this quasi-"descent into madness" - let's just say that if you're reading this and want to give up, please don't give up, the ending makes it worth it.starts off in tone very similar to the disney movie (except there's no madam mim here), with wonderful irreverence and "old england" - over the course of the books it gets darker, bloodier, and more depressing, noble knights and wonderful creatures like the questing beast and dragons and giants disappear to make space for cannons and backstabbing intrigues by "bastard" children, the "oedipussian" inevitability of lancelot's, guinevere's and arthur's downfall makes reading hard to bear.reading this book makes me feel like i'm nine years old with an uncle who is a world authority in le morte d'arthur, i'm at his place for the holidays and he decided to summarize the whole story for me with humor, but with more than enough respect for the (often bloody) source, and with enough sense to always use modern (well, british 1930s) references like cricket to explain chivalry or jousting.underneath it all is the question of how to stop wars, and whether there ever can be right by the use of might (hitler is referenced several times) - the author's solution in merlin's voice seems to be some kind of free capitalism with no real borders, but we have developed a version of that since the book's publication, and what has that done for us? little "large" wars, but staggering inequalities.an extremely detailed, long biography of charles darwin - more a social biography than a scientific one. the authors go to lengths to put every stage in darwin's life in the context of the bigger social movements surrounding darwin.some other things i learned:- if you've got an earth-shattering theory, make sure that everybody respects you based on other work first; darwin published a geological book on coral reefs, and then worked for 5 years on barnacles. you'll also need influential friends who will publicly support your theories, and fight for them.- similar to galileo in feyerabend's against method, the war around natural selection wasn't won using science, but propaganda. darwin had many scientific friends who fought his public wars for him, thomas huxley being at the front. i have to read a biography on huxley, "darwin's bulldog", next - luckily adrian desmond wrote on, too.- ideas never stand alone in a vacuum. i knew before this book that darwin's theories on natural selection are based on the already known concept of evolution, on malthus and lyell. this book does a great job of exhibiting all minor and major influences on darwin's thinking.- something i heard for the first time in this book is how precarious darwin's health was. psychosomatic? crohn's disease? the book never explains it, but after every minor period of stress, darwin either vomited or had to retreat to his bed for a week. he rarely held public speeches, preferring letters. bad reviews could send him to bed for weeks. (on writing this i checked google - at least one publication says he had crohn's disease)- back then, people had their children late in life - i remember at least one couple in the book where the mother gives birth to her first child at 38. darwin's wife emma gave birth to their last, tenth child at the age of 48. people say that "older" mothers are a recent trend, doesn't seem to be the case?- darwin pioneered a few approaches for which we have fancy buzzwords now. he tracked most of the things he did, including all scores of all backgammon games against his wife, his health - we call that quantified self now. on scientific questions, he tracked and kept all minor details about his work - sending out questionnaires to all parties that could possibly have anything to do with the question, which before him wasn't that common.- science 150 years ago had a completely different model of funding. darwin himself was mostly funded by his father, the voyage of the beagle was completely paid for by dr. darwin. later on, darwin's money came from farms his father bought him, living the dickensian dream. at the beginning of darwin's career, science was mostly done by "unemployed gentlemen scholars" (of which there is nowadays only one), but the employment model changed during his life towards what we have now, mostly government-funded.- since the majority of this book is based on letters, i wonder how biographies of the future will work. nowadays it's all emails, most of them in password-protected data vaults that will disappear when the hosting company (inevitably) disappears. i'd like to read scientific journals of historians a hundred years in the future - with publications such as "how to restore e-mails from the early 21st century email client, mozilla thunderbird".- like many successful people, darwin (for the longest time) didn't know what he wanted to do with his life. he had a pokemon-like obsession with collecting bugs, the voyage of the beagle only happened because of luck. reassuring if you're, like me, one of those people who for the longest time just drifted along in life.- huxley coined "agnostic" when he got annoyed that opponents of natural selection always tried to drag the debate onto religious grounds. haeckel (nowadays mostly known for his beautiful naturalistic paintings) coined many terms we use today in biology - "phylum", "phylogeny", and many more. the story of haeckel, with his broken english, meeting darwin, with his barely existing german, is one of the cutest stories in the book.not recommended for: people who want their history cut-and-dry; this book belongs to narrative history, often describing things which the author could have no way of knowing.recommended for: people who like to trace the development of ideas. fans of the history of biology. this book describes two 'modes' or 'metaphors' for software development - the old 'cathedral' one, in which a few programmers, locked away from the world, slowly release iterations of their software to the world, a mode employed by the business world. then there's the new 'bazaar', in which rapid development around a core team of developers is favoured, developers who are constantly in contact with users and co-developers - most of open source software development happens like this.it's an interesting time-document that directly led to the founding of what's now known as mozilla, but it's also outdated. reading the arguments i couldn't help but constantly think 'but what about heartbleed?' for most points - for those few who haven't heard of it, heartbleed is/was a huge security bug in the widely used openssl library that enabled attackers to read arbitrary memory of any ssl-enabled webserver.especially towards the end the book builds up a few straw-men to take down, and then it gets annoying - like when the book says that 'bazaar' style development doesn't need the business (cathedral) world's top-down style management, because open source is just so much fun that it doesn't need managers! 'but what about heartbleed?': the openssl code is such a notorious mess that for years developers who wanted to fix any problems recoiled as if encountering a lovecraftian horror, quickly abandoning their good intentions to save their sanity. the argument of 'many shallow eyes see all important bugs' obviously didn't pan out, the bug existed for years.only now are some openbsd people working on fixing openssl in libressl, but for them it's a concerted effort with 'management' involved, so it seems to be some kind of chimera between bazaar and cathedral, in which only very few 'outsiders' are involved.i guess bazaar style development doesn't work that well for security relevant software; it's insanely complicated and there are too many 'bad' agents (like the nsa) who can act as good 'customers of the bazaar'. but it still goes some good points here and there, like for example this one:treating your users as co-developers is your least-hassle route to rapid code improvement and effective debugging.it's a quick read, i'd recommend it to all open source programmers interested into seeing where their hobby comes from.update 30.12.2014: i just found this longer good essay revisiting the main points of the book, quote:that is the sorry reality of the bazaar raymond praised in his book: a pile of old festering hacks, endlessly copied and pasted by a clueless generation of it "professionals" who wouldn't recognize sound it architecture if you hit them over the head with it. it is hard to believe today, but under this embarrassing mess lies the ruins of the beautiful cathedral of unix, deservedly famous for its simplicity of design, its economy of features, and its elegance of execution. (sic transit gloria mundi, etc.)recommended reading!interesting short look into a subculture that ceased existing in the 50s, and into japan from 1910 to 1950 - the english title is a bit unfitting and too flashy. the original title, which roughly translates to "the age of the asakusa gamblers", fits best (and in this case, the word for gamblers is bakuto). the main character of the book is a yakuza, but not the kind you associate with it today - their only trade is illegal gambling, the kind of gambling you might know from samurai period movies. you know: three guys sitting at a table, the guy in the middle half-naked who's job it is to throw the dice, everybody shouting 'odds!' or 'even!' to bet on the outcome, the other two guys collecting or handing out money, that's it.there are a couple of wonderful scenes - for example, at one point the yakuza are told by the police to hand in all of their guns or they would be shut down. since guns were practically impossible to get, they didn't have any, but in order to escape persecution they had to move heaven and earth to find some. in the end, they bought three guns, each at the price of a house, so they could hand those in to the police.it's not particularly well-written (translated?), and the story stays a bit unfocused, but it's quite interesting.a biography of robert oppenheimer that is also a history of jewish immigration and the inner life of second generation migrants, of quantum physics, of the manhattan project, of quantum electrodynamics, of mccarthy's communism hysteria, the history of theoretical physics as an institution in the united states, and much more. one of the last polymaths, oppenheimer could read sanskrit and greek, speak and read several languages (he liked to quote baudelaire in french, and his famous quote 'now, i am become death, the destroyer of worlds' from the bhagavad gita comes from his reading it in the sanskrit), yet for all of his intelligence he had quite a few brainfarts in his time. without his stupid and unnecessary lies in the 50s, the entire fbi communist scare theatre in which  he lost his security clearance wouldn't have happened this way. his earlier physics papers had quite a few mathematical errors, but he did predict the existence of positrons and of black holes.this book is full of small, beautiful details and inspiring stories, too many to quote here. i only have '18246 characters left'.recommended for: fans of everything.not recommended for: people who need to see thoughts laid out in linear time. when describing the development of physical theories, monk has a habit of jumping into the future, as in: 'the first clue towards this new particle was #{something} (20 years later, it was revealed that this particle was actually two particles). the second clue was #{something else}.' it's a bit like holmes describing the first clue, then revealing who the murder was, and then revealing the second clue.p.s.: who knew that after relativity, einstein's contributions to physics were less than minor for more than 30 years?p.p.s.: two quotes of oppenheimer that are very important today.on secrecy around the atomic bombs:there is grave danger for us that these decisions have been taken on the basis of facts held secret. this is not because the men who must contribute to the decisions, or must make them, are lacking in wisdom; it is because wisdom itself cannot flourish, nor even truth be determined, without the give and take of debate and criticism. the relevant facts could be of little use to an enemy,yet they are indispensable for an understanding of questions of policy.on knowing yourself:it is the knowledge of the inwardness of evil, and an awareness that in our dealings with this we are very close to the center of life. it is true of us as a people that we tend to see all devils as foreigners,; it is true of us ourselves, most of us, who are not artists, that in our public life, and to a distressing extent our private life as well, we reflect and project and externalize what we cannot bear to see within us. when we are blind to the evil in ourselves, we dehumanize ourselves, and we deprive ourselves not only of our own destiny, but of any possibility of dealing with the evil in others.it's hard to write a review about this, since i'm sure i've missed more than half of the allusions, in-jokes, hints contained in here - all the parallelisms between the story of pilate and the story of the master, the elements from different faust retellings, the book within a book telling the story of jesus (at time funny, at times sad), the satire of soviet life and bureaucracy, etc., pp... it's a book that, with each reading, reveals more.(this particular edition does a good job of explaining the more obscure jokes in the appendix)oh, what a book.james (who i'd never heard of before) summarizes a lifetime of reading, and note-taking, and it's essay-sized fireworks for 800+ pages. he usually starts off with a mini-biography of the essay's namesake, only then to go wherever the links take him - reading these essays feels like talking to someone who's in love with his work. 'this guy wrote some of the greatest essays ever, oh by the way if you like him there's this half-forgotten contemporary artist whose arias you should listen to, did i tell you i once met his cousin and we had the most wonderful discussion of aristotle?' - this breathless love is how most of the essays are structured.the essays are ordered alphabetically, james writes that this order is arbitrary, yet i can't help but think that it's no coincidence that the book ends with the essay on stefan zweig. the austrian kaffeehaus-culture of liberal humanism under the roof of the arts is one of the major themes of all essays. the destruction of the austrian culture by the austria's anschluß (the word anschluß appears at least 50 times) and the scattering of paris' intellectuals during the german invasion, is heavily implied to be the worst thing to have happened to the european intellectual life in the last 100 years, and most of the essays focus on that particular group of people. it's a joy to read his takedown of sartre, and his love for such greats as polar, camus, chamfort, croce, kafka, friedell,  reich-ranicki (as a german, that made me happy) is gigantic and jumps off the pages, infecting you. i've underlined so many books, it's going to be a minor chore to add them to my to-read shelf.luckily, james is also a funny writer:lysenko preached the kind of biological theories that stalin could understand: i.e., they were poppycock.some of the essays are rather strange, in these, james just goes off the track too far. the essay on sophie scholl quickly morphs into one about natalie portman (and portman gets way more pages, weirdly enough), the essay on charlie chaplin immediately turns into a lacklustre discussion of art vs. science (and i've read better things about that particular 'conflict'), one essay is a bit about how the 'degeneration' of english is bad: as a biologist, i firmly believe that people who hold beliefs like that would have stood on shore while the first reptile crawled on land, telling the reptile to 'stop degenerating'. the essay on heinrich heine is just an overlong negative rant about autograph seekers.the worst essay is also the most australian one, in which he rants for pages on pages on how the afghani asylum seekers on board the tampa bound to australia in 2001 are just 'illegal immigrants' and 'queue jumpers', who should have just stayed in their home country until their application would have been accepted. it's especially worse because james, at that point, has spent 400 pages being in love with ww2-era intellectuals who've done nothing but 'jump queues' when they've escaped their home-country - can you imagine einstein just sitting in germany while the gestapo is kicking down doors, waiting for his letter of invitation? thomas mann, too, was allowed into the usa without any papers, and czechoslovakia even offered him citizenship so that he could formally immigrate.sometimes, his own character comes through too much, i think this is best exemplified by this sentence:when filming in rome, i had a jacket made by the celebrated tailor littrico, and found out that i had the same measurements as gorbachev: they were on file in littrico's office.to which i can only say: so what?but these rohrkrepierer-essays are in the tiny minority. i'd love to see a book like this on the life and work of scientists (if i remember correctly, only one of the 'good' essays has to do with science).recommended for: people who can't get enough stuff into their brain.not recommended for: people who, if they go on travelling to a beautiful country, get angry if there's a detour.this is so british, in my imagination every single character was played by stephen fry.highly recommended reading if you want to learn more about manic depression/bipolar disorder, from a psychologist who suffers from manic depression/bipolar disorder. her illness started in the 1970s when lithium had just started as the recommended drug (and in much higher doses than today). the interest in her mood-swings led her to start a successful career as a psychiatrist, which greatly benefits this book - she's able to write objectively about her massive mood-swings, her suicide attempt, the genetic basis of her illness and the stages of her illness (it's a huge difference from mark vonnegut's ). it's an extremely honest and open book: she goes through all of her relationships and their reaction to her illness, along with her losses and gains, i couldn't write a book like this.one thing to note is that when you have a mental disorder, it seems to be very useful when most of your friends are psychiatrists - they can immediately see when you accidentally overdose, write drug prescriptions for you, and are much better at judging your actions when the illness takes over.i can't believe someone from belgium wrote this in 1951; feels more like actual memoirs than a fictional recollection.it starts off a bit slow (possibly just me getting used to the style), but becomes good somewhere around the middle. amazing life and person; someone to emulate.recommended for: fans of ancient rome/greece, people looking for a role model.p.s.: seems to be a famous book - weirdly enough, completely unknown in germany, it doesn't even have a wikipedia article in german. the new 2008 edition has the strange title "ich zähmte die wölfin", which translates to "i tamed the wolf" (wolf being the female form). ???nice mini-autobiography of king, with the majority of the book focusing on tips on writing if you want to write in king's style, i.e., don't use adverbs, just write and don't plan (now i know where these endings come from), write for a specific person, etc., pp. bonus star for being honest, king isn't the world's 'artiest' writer and he knows it.a good guide to 'difficult conversations' with boss/spouse/people, i.e., clashing stories, themes that endanger your self-image, and emotions, it contains some valuable advice on how to incorporate everyone's and your own feelings in a mature way during a conversation.but: for the love of all that is holy, do not follow the advice contained in this book with children. i had teachers who went to university in the 'progressive' 70s, so what they talked about all day is your feelings and their feelings and it's all very annoying when you just want to set things on fire. the authors circumvent the issue by pretending that children don't exist. a note like 'btw, this stuff doesn't work with children' would have helped.what i expected:source, cc-by-nc 2.5what i got:"what is life?" is a surprisingly humble take on the problems biology had in the 1940s. schrödinger tries to summarize how physics and chemistry can help solve biology's problems, like how information is actually inherited. he often comes so close to the actual truth that you want to shout at the book while reading it - i wonder what he would have done with rosalind franklin's x-ray diffraction images of dna.... in other times he's a bit lost, like when he thinks that new physical laws are needed to solve the riddle of heredity; as far as i know, we didn't need to come up with new laws. i don't think that's his fault, though: he was just hypothesizing from the data available to him at that time.one of the cooler concepts schrödinger introduces is the concept of life as a system that "eats" entropy and thereby evades thermodynamic equilibrium, as predicted by the second law of thermodynamics.the book itself is further proof that scientists never operate in an intellectual vacuum, every great discovery is based on preceeding thougts. both watson and crick, the discoverers of the dna-structure, had read the book. without it i doubt they would have thought of the structure the way they did.the second book "mind and matter" is much more philosophical in nature and concerns free will, the self and how we perceive the world. here schrödinger quotes indian scripture to make his point that the subject and object are one, conciousness isn't as clear cut as people commonly believe, etc. if you're into that this part will bore you. it did, however, contain a small discussion of cultural heredity in the form of "mnemes" - something which has been popularized by dawkins in the last few decades.recommended for: fans of science, it's so short you can read it in an afternoon. people interested in the history of science, what is life? is one of the most influental scientific books of the last 100 years (judging on how many scientists cite it as their prime inspiration to get into biology).more a bill of indictment than a history book, chang's rape of nanking details one of the bigger war crimes of the japanese in world war 2, the mass murder and mass rape of chinese soldiers and civilians in nanking, with an estimated 40,000 to 300,000 dead in the course of six weeks, and an estimated 20,000 women raped. the wikipedia article has photos, it's not safe for lunch or work.chang wrote the book out of anger over the crime being either forgotten, or actively downplayed by the japanese and it clearly shows in the book - there's lots of judgmental language (a "brave crusader" sues the japanese government, the chinese defended shanghai with "extraordinary valor" etc.) so if you want a truly unbiased neutral account you have to read the wikipedia article (edit: but i don't think the book distorts the facts). it's a very, very depressing book - first the history that led up to this massacre, then the massacre itself, several eyewitness accounts (including from the diary of the german john rabe), and a bit on how the massacre is treated nowadays.it's a slightly older book, some things have shifted since then - ishihara shintaro is quoted as a denier of the rape of nanking, after the publication of this book he became governor of tokyo (his wikipedia article is mostly "other controversial statements", like a mean version of prince philip) . i feel that in recent times, the issue of "comfort women" (forced prostitutes) has taken over the debate, especially since japan finally started to pay some reparations to korea in december 2015 (an issue that extends far beyond korea - chinese, philippine, vietnamese, thai, dutch, australian etc. women were forced into prostitution, like ellen van der ploeg.) of course there's a sizable and loud minority in japan that asserts that these women were all voluntary prostitutes or are lying to get money from japan.germany actually recently made a movie about john rabe, the "good german of nanking", good reviews but it did quite poorly in terms of revenue, i guess people are tired of ww2 dramas.one thing that i'd like to add, which is missing in the book, is that the conflict about japanese war-crimes between china, japan and korea is still ongoing because it's a useful tool to conservatives on both sides when it comes to debated territories like the senkaku islands or the liancourt rocks (gas, oil resources). the japanese say "our opponents come up with these lies to gain the upper hand in this conflict, make us look bad, and force money and concessions out of us!", and the korean and chinese say "the japanese are still lying about their crimes, how can we trust them now?". this won't end very soon, both sides are at a stalemate. it's a bit easier for germany to recognise its own crimes because germany is not fighting with poland over resources, there is nothing to lose.i've been reading the recent , and there are some good points on the destruction of the state as a prerequisite for an excess of violence which would fit very well here. if you're into japanese literature this might interest you: in his younger days ishihara was a good friend of , the guy in this this famous picture of mishima is ishihara.fun ghost stories from 1905; mostly strange to me as a european because our "traditional" stories always have a moral, or some point, like "don't stray from the given path", "listen to your superiors" etc. pp. japanese ghost stories rarely have a moral, the doom brought by ghosts or spirits befalls the good and the evil alike. karma exists but it it's more useful for reincarnation - there is no all-encompassing "good" like in the christian worldview.the entire folklore of japanese yokai is fascinating, and hearn touches on some of them, like the yuki-onna, but it's often feels like hearn influences the stories too much.the last few chapters are all weird, starting with an autobiographical story of hearn that i did not particularly care for, then continuing with a strange description of horai, a mythical chinese and japanese place, but the description differs from anything else in the japanese literature and must have been mostly invented by hearn. sadly, this "taints" the other preceding stories: i can't tell whether hearn influenced them, or if they're "proper" japanese stories. even weirder is the finishing chapter with hearn's thoughts on butterflies, mosquitoes and ants. interestingly he described that ants keep mushrooms, i thought that was a more recent discovery.recommended for: fans of japan, and those who like folklore stories. i think most people can skip the last 3 chapters.do you like pink floyd? remember 'no one told you when to run, you missed the starting gun'? in a way, this novel's narrator completely missed the gun - he's 37, has never really connected with his family, always did what he was told.. his mother is diagnosed with cancer, in a panicky attempt he tries to reconnect with her, but she's obviously got other problems. it's a fine, quiet description of a life not really lived.  so why did i give this only 3 stars? i think i'm too young for this. in 20 years, or so, this book might resonate more with me.i liked this one even less than the first one -it manages to create a fantasy-world completely devoid of wonder. when tolkien creates the world of lotr, he gives the reader only a glimpse of what tolkien has built - he tells you that there are a ton of different races, but in the story not all of them appear; tolkien tells you that all of these races have complete, twisted, intertwined back-stories, but gives you only a glimpse, as much as you need to know. butcher, on the other hand, creates only exactly as much back story as needed - there are 3 types of werewolves, ergo all of them have to appear (however ham-fisted their inclusion in the story is ), he tells you all there is about them (not much) and then has all the characters act out all there is to them, nothing is left to the fog... in other words: if butcher had directed the original star wars trilogy, boba fett wouldn't have had a helmet.and, i get that most of the characters are wolves, but honestly, using 'he/she/it snarled' instead of the classic 'he said' gets tiring fast.takes elements from 40s and 50s noir, melts them with "urban fantasy", and adds some elements from the 90s rpg arcanum, to create a wizard/private investigator who specializes on "otherworldly" investigations. there's of course a murder, a bit of damsel in distress, a few friends in low places, a couple of bad guys, and magic, everything you'd expect from the mix.sometimes the "fantasy" and the "noir" elements clash for the worse, butcher has to pull some story tricks to have an overpowered wizard who's also the downbeaten looser who's in a case over his head, and it doesn't work well all the time.still, it's a fun, quick read if you want something to entertain you for an afternoon or a trainride. i might pick up all the following books, too.this book summarizes the worst atrocities of the 20th century, not as some kind of freakshow, but as examples in how human psychology and ethics can be bent to enable people to commit the worst mankind has done in its 200,000 years of history. glover doesn't offer many solutions for the future (maybe in another book?) except that we need political restraints on a world scale (but: if you have a world police, that police can kill without problems) and we need to learn how to develop ethics and psychology in the face of technology that enables us to kill men, women, children at the press of a button.a few personal takeaways:- people actually learn from history, and they actually learn from books! during the cuba missile crisis the soviets cited their personal war experience and kennedy cited the first world war, especially tuchman's guns of august, as reasons why they did not want to continue the conflict (as a sidenote, reading the letters and opinions of the us military leaders who wanted to keep the conflict going makes you realize how realistic jack d. ripper in dr. strangelove is)- history repeats itself, all the time; when the athenians attacked the melians, they 'presented  hard amoralism as mere realism'. everyone else has done that since, here in australia the current government clouds their inhumanity in the guise of 'adults being in charge'.- in a way, the first world war was present at nagasaki and hiroshima. glover makes a nice case how the 'modern' sliding of standards in regards to the death of civilians in wartime started at the blockade of hamburg in ww1, went on to the indiscriminate bombing of civilians from germans and the british, and culminated in the atomic bombs. if this book would have come out later it would have included indiscriminate drone killings in the middle east in that slide.- internet trolls with absolute horrifying opinions in the comment section of news-articles are nothing new: another american massacre of japanese survivors in lifeboats provoked a letter of moral criticism, which was published. many of the replies to that letter claimed that japanese atrocities justified the massacre. one reader wrote of 'killing a helpless rattlesnake'. another had 'thoroughly enjoyed' reading about the slaughter'. another said that a 'good old american custom i would like to see is nailing a jap hide on every "backhouse" door in america'.- glover doesn't like heidegger in the slightest: 'the inarticulate complexity is heidegger's trademark. can someone whose thinking is so blurred be a serious philosopher?' or even better (you have to know that heidegger once wrote that hitler's hands were beautiful):to imagine a meeting between them, with heidegger glancing at hitler's marvellous hands and talking about the unity of the outside-of-itself in the raptures of the future, is to be reminded how easily the führer was moved to rage. that the two men did not meet is one of surrealism's great losses in the twentieth century.not recommended for: 1) the squeamish. every atrocity is introduced with several personal eyewitness accounts, it makes for good nightmare material. in fact, i think i had weird nightmares every single night while reading this book (but: correlation != causation)2) people who love people, your beliefs might take a punch:the widespread enthusiasm even now for capital punishment seems to reflect something more than a concern to reduce crime rates. when capital punishment was the law in britain, there were about five applications a week for the post of executioner.recommended for: people interested in changing the future by learning from the past.great account of both wars in chechnya, from a russian journalist who, for reasons unknown to him, volunteered for the second, and then came back as a journalist to report on chechnya after the war (spoiler: people still die in droves, but russia just fakes a layer of fake peace on top of reality).as it's more therapy than novel the structure is 'patchy', the author wrote what he had to write, with little regard for 'setting up scene', or whether the stories are connected. since this is reality, there is no 'red thread' going through the book - people appear, they disappear, they reappear, most of the time they die.the major theme of the novel is brutality, so if you can't stomach that, stay away. in this book the russian army has a pecking order based on sheer brutality, the new ones get beaten up by the old ones, the higher rungs beat up the lower ones, etc. - and not just a slap, but kicks in the face until teeth fall out, every night. chechen warriors disembowel captured russians, or publicly slit their throats. people get blown up, so that only a foot is sent home in a zinc coffin, welded shut. mothers of missing soldiers are accidentally shot - they've come to chechnya to find their sons, since the chaotic russian army can't really keep track of anything. deserters run away? eh, so what, they'll die anyway. newcomers steal some ammunition? the officers get drunk, beat up the newcomers brutally over days, mock-execute them, until they kick them out naked into chechnya; left to die.i can't really understand the comparison to catch-22 in goodreads' description - catch-22 was an over-the-top satire which took many freedoms to get the point across, one soldier's war is just nihilist brutality from start to end.this is a surprisingly interesting book - the author sets out to show that north korea has two 'sets' of propaganda, one is mainly used internally, the other is shown to the world. the outdoor propaganda is juche thought, a relatively inconsistent quasi-communist waffling no-one really bothers to understand or 'fix'. the internal propaganda (called 'the text' in the book) is interesting - a racist national set of ideas, initially copied from the japanese under hirohito, and then amended over the decades. the koreans are the 'purest' people, and since they're so 'pure' they need protection from the outside world from the dear leader, the most korean korean. the koreans are a child-like race too pure, under constant threat from  outside evils such as 'yankees', diverse 'puppet regimes' of the yankees like the south koreans, and other threats to their purity. it's a little bit like north koreans see themselves like one of these overbred dogs who can't walk up stairs on his own.this is all very interesting to learn, especially as the depth of western media's reporting on the dprk can be summarized as 'look at these weirdos lololol here's the weather' myers seems to have strong opinions on other western dprk researchers, and since i know very little about north koreans, i can't judge how accurate he is. in fact, if what this book says it's true, it's going to be much, much more difficult to change the political situation in north korea than it was in east germany - east germans saw the economical success of west germany and wanted the same which was one of the factors leading to collapse, north korea sees the economical success of south korea and treats it as a sign of their 'unpure' depravity. even if the military leadership is replaced or eliminated like in iraq, people won't be cheering - you can't just replace an entire mythology, taught over 50 years, over night and think people will accept you.sadly this book is a bit short, and was published before kim jong-un became leader/president/head honcho. i would've liked to read what myers thinks of kim jong-un - he certainly seems to portray the 'child-like' in the north korean mythology very well . as a biologist, i would have also liked to read more about the 'scientific' side of the racist myth, since the soviet union had their own science (lysenkoism) and ran experiments etc. does that scientific side even exist?bonus fact: you can read this book pretending it's about an alien race on venus and it still works!recommended for: people interested in authoritarian regimes, different ways to view the world, korea, communism, and those who like to read excerpts from strange, alien novels.not recommended for: people who like to cling to their belief that north korea is led by a bunch of bumbling fools. seriously, on all official pictures he looks like a fat baby.not much to say about this one - a quick read if you want to have something "adventurous", think indiana jones or karl may, but nothing special or spectacular. weird and racist treatment of africans, especially the way the translated dialogue is always presented in this fake old english language (thine/doth/etc.), they're all "noble savages", whites and blacks shouldn't 'mix' etc. pp. recommended for: 12 year old boys, might make a good introduction to reading (but there are better alternatives, like treasure island)just like "the book of strange new things", on the surface this is sf, but once you read it it's so much unlike the rest of science fiction - and every time i try to summarise the story in one sentence, it sounds like pulp 60s sf from ae van vogt (summary: aliens have a secret farm in scotland, a female of their species has been operated to look like a human, she drives around and picks up strong male hitch-hikers, who she drugs and kidnaps to the farm. the hitchhikers are then fattened and sold on their home-world as a delicacy . see?). but unlike "classic" sf, this one is much more about the inner life of the characters. the book is best when the alien has just picked up a hitchhiker - it's always the nervous, broken inner monologue of the alien who fears that she may be discovered, and who dies on the inside as she knows that she'll never be able to return - then it switches over to her passenger, who in scottish dialect tries to make sense of her (often on a sexual level). most of the time these "non-dialogues" are hilariously awkward, like when she tries to find a topic to small-talk in order to find out whether the police will look for the hitchhiker, while he tries to find any topic to start on.recommended for: vegetarians? not recommended for: people who can't see past the sf for the longest time, i thought there would be a twist in the end that reveals that the aliens are actually time travelers from the future since their world is so much like a classic human dystopia, but no twist.non-fiction by one of the more famous names in recent sf (most famous for coining "cyberspace").some essays here feel a bit unnecessary, like the introductions to books i've never read, so they kind of hang there in empty space. others are so dated that they're fun to read, but not much else ("have you heard of this thing called 'ebay'???"). the best ones are about the "future" (with a capital f), the future that he grew up believing in in the 50s to the 70s - the one with the jetpacks and the space ships, the boundless optimism. that future that has now merged into "our" future, less optimism, more an ever present "now". the essays surrounding this change are the best ones.the weirdest few essays are the ones about japan - i see a completely different japan compared to gibson. gibson's japan already exists in the optimistic perfectionist future (even after the economy crashed!), "my" japan is a special kind of hell with 80 hour work weeks lacking any vision, working not to achieve something, but because your surroundings expect it.i'd say this is recommendable to gibson fans, but not really anyone else. 2.5?from the cover, i thought this is going to be a krach-bumm space battleship action novel - what i got instead is a thoughtful, mature, sf novel with some interesting ideas. it doesn't try to force its ideas on to you (like a certain heinlein), instead, ideas are partially explored, leaving the rest of the reader (for example, how are ancillaries actually in contact?).some things i liked:- addiction is pretty realistically described- logical, "human" politics- the idea of ancillaries (connected dead bodies that are inhabited by parts of the same ai, but which can act on their own) is fun, and leads to some special situations: the narrator can describe scenes from different angles, and since the ai's data is manipulated we also have some kind of unreliable narrator thing going on- the narration has a certain "stoic", quiet, mature feel to itrecommended for: fans of sf for adultsstrangely enough, the author's epilogue on his life and the stories evoked more emotions in me than the stories themselvesa very interesting take on agriculture with a focus on plants and their future - the author applies dawkin's selfish gene concept to explain and hypothesize about various concepts floating around agriculture right now. he's got three basic ideas on which the book is based on - the first is that natural selection doesn't miss easy ror tradeoff-free improvements; in these chapters there's disappointment in the promises of gm-advocates, as the "low hanging fruits" of plant improvement may not exist. i don't fully agree with this - after all, evolution hasn't stopped and given us perfect species, and without the fitting natural selection, the low hanging fruit may still be there - but i can see what he means. the second point is that competitive success is better than success by persisting - for example,  forests or ecosystems usually don't compete against each other, so there is no telling whether their actual composition is "ideal" or not - maybe yes, maybe no, the point is that the blind copying of this abundance can either help or hurt, we have no clue as to what outside pressures these compositions developed. just because they have persisted doesn't mean that should blindly copy them.in these chapters are the best (and most science-fiction-ish) ideas - for example, wheat grows larger because of inter-individual competition for light, which isn't good for us humans since then yield is lower, the plant has to put resources into growing instead of into our food. borlaug reversed this process by introducing dwarf wheat with a much higher yield. denison propose that we create plants that actually cooperate each other, for example, by making sure that plants in the vicinity get enough light, while the plants grow in such a way that harmful weeds are shaded. quite outlandish, but doable! there's also a very interesting discussion on assisting plants in selecting for "helpful" rhizobia in varying nodules.right now our only successes in plant modification is that they express toxins, which is relatively easy, it's just a single gene that isn't particularly part of any system. if you start to modify salinity resistance, for example, the image gets bleaker - we've had some success by introducing ion pumps from salinity-resistant species, but these systems are still too unknown to drastically improve yield. changing species so that they cooperate, that's still far, far away.the third point is a relatively obvious one - we should always hedge bets and not bet on just one approach, this chapter is a bit more political as it includes various taxing schemes (an interesting nitrogen-tax is proposed where farmers pay per kg of nitrogen used, but get a tax bonus for every kg that is actually used - for example, 1000kg of wheat use 23kg of nitrogen, so these 23kg would receive a bonus).i don't always agree with his ideas, for example, he's a bit disappointed that so much money is being poured into the various -omics approaches while the "classic" fields of ecology and agronomy are being underfunded, he's disappointed that so many people work with arabidopsis while there are so many alternative plants to work at, but i think that the omics stuff is still so early, and we still know so little about other, more complicated plants that it makes sense to keep on working with the relatively simple arabidopsis.. for now. some people try to model the human brain, but more people are working on the simple c. elegans with its exactly 302 neurons. bonus quote:do legumes, like the farm-owners in the grapes of wrath, advertise more openings than actually exist, to attract a surplus of applicants?recommended for: plant biologists, breeders, interested laymen, people interested in the future of agriculture, people interested in the big picturea collection of the forgotten  russian writer and poet, mostly short stories (or rather, short scenes) and a few scenes in verse. the stories are short, very funny, and dark! for example, in one of the first stories the main character tries to kill himself by locking himself into an airtight trunk, but the trunk just disappears:"that means life defeated death by a method unknown to me."says the character, and thus the story ends, just after one page.some otherworldly elements reminding me of murakami exist in all stories, like this one:i found out that sharik, cinderyushkin and misha usually live in our stove. it's hard for me to comprehend how they got settled in there.if you, like most germans, grew up with helge schneider: kharms is a darker version of him, with more death and 'lebensmuedigkeit', but equally funny.however, the constant non sequitors do get tiring if you read several of the pieces at once; possibly the reason why i enjoyed this less than i should have. i think?tl;dr: a mixed bagi'm not exactly sure what to make of this book - it's a hard-boiled noir story, but not set in the usual world of pis and dames, but in the world of the carnival and travelling 'mediums' and spirit-talkers.the problem is that only the beginning and the end are really interesting - the beginning reminding me of the awesome 1932 movie freaks and also of one of the best x-files episode (sadly, no guy tattooed in puzzles appears); the end is a great character study of someone loosing his grips on reality. the rest of the book is just a not-so-interesting story of a guy i didn't care for, and saw no reason to care for, trying to scam everything and everybody, 'mark' after 'mark'. the only cool parts there are the detailed descriptions and hints how he pulled these scams off, except for, i think, one trick. the rest was boring to me.recommended for: fans of hard-boiled noirnot recommended for: the restgave me peculiar, highly special form of sadnessyou know enough to know how you feel is senseless, but you don't know enough to know why.tl;dr: classic philosophy, mixed with old-people-opinionsthis is really good if you want to have a primer into stoicism - the writing in these letters is straightforward, each letter handles two or three themes and is usually only a couple of pages long.the annoying parts are seneca's old-people-opinions, some of which are:1. people who stay up all night are terrible2. 'for it is silly  to spend one's time exercising the biceps'3. popular styles are terrible: 'it's object is to sway a mass audience'4. everything was better in the past and the present is bad ('the earth herself, untilled, was more productive, her yields being more than ample for the needs of peoples who did not raid each other.' etc. pp. - the same arguments 2000 years later repeated in the terrible ishmael)but, to quote the man,we should hunt out the helpful pieces of teaching, and the spirited and noble-minded sayings which are capable of immediate practical application  and learn them so well that words become works.and of these 'helpful pieces of teaching' the letters are chock-full.bonus best quote:lucius piso was drunk from the very moment of his appointment as warden of the city of rome.fun!an introduction to job interviews for programmers, how to prepare, what to expect, and the "do"s and "don't"s. it begins with how to start your job-hunt, finding your strengths, updating your linkedin (reasonable tips there!), and finding the job that suits you. since programming interviews are often technical in nature, the majority of this book focuses on these parts. it goes over all the basic data-structures and gives you a couple of example problems from interviews for each structure. these are good in that the author goes through a "natural" thinking process with each problem - starting with the "obvious" and "easy" solution, showing where the caveats are, "loudly" thinking about possible ways to solve it, finding the "good" solution, and then sometimes going further to the "perfect" solution (which doesn't help in interviews, but is there for pure nerd-satisfaction). after a problem was solved in "plain text", example programs are included. these are written in java, c++ or c. a warning here: many solutions include low-level concepts like pointers (or even pointers to pointers), so if you've only programmed in languages without "manual pointers" like python or ruby this book won't help you much. in fact, the string problems are a little bit frustrating to read when you know the solution in python would be a (slow) one-liner like my_string.split(" ") (that one's surprisingly complicated in c).after going through all the basic data-structures like binary trees, stacks, heaps, strings etc. a couple of non-datastructure cs related things pop up, like graphics programming, concurrency, sql etc., which i rarely see, but good to see them included here. then there are a few chapters on the typical "riddles", like this one (which doesn't even work with modern light-bulbs - leds don't get hot, fluorescent bulbs only a little), but the authors rightly state that these are cheap pot-shots which don't really help in anything. but since they come up in interviews, they had to be included. the book concludes with a couple of examples for "knowledge"-based questions, and a helpful appendix on structuring/writing cvs.recommended for: job-hunting programmers, or those in the last year of their studies. people who've never been to a technical programming interview and would like to know what to expect. people who like to solve programming riddles. people who need a crash-course/refresher on data-structures and algorithms.not recommended for: beginning programmers (too much low-level stuff). people who only program in high-level languages like python or ruby. people who want to study programming interview questions specifically - there are other, bigger, more complete books on that (but i don't really see the purpose behind that - in my own experience, people who learn programming solutions by heart  can't program at all, which will hopefully become obvious in the interview).alternative title: "what it's like to over-think everything"this is the transcript of a series of interviews david lipsky did with david foster wallace on the last half of his "infinite jest" reading tour through the us - the book was a success, and wallace was becoming famous, being on the cover of time and whatnot. there's a bit of essays on wallace, his success and suicide around the interviews from lipsky, but the majority of the books is wallace's answers and elaborations of answers to questions of lipsky. i'd say 80% of the text is wallace speaking, and it's great to read the thoughts of someone who's so upfront and honest about himself:what i’m trying to say to you is, i went through a period so bad, that that stuff had to stop mattering to me, or i think i would’ve blown my brains out. i came reasonably close. from time to time lipsky injects his personal observations into the texts with , which feels like lipsky is trying to remind the reader that lipsky still exists, they don't add much and often break the flow of the answer.worthy of a read just because of this quote (and now i spoiled it for you!)i think the reason why people behave in an ugly manner is that it’s really scary to be alive and to be human, and people are really really afraid. and that the reasons  that the fear is the basic condition, and there are all kinds of reasons for why we’re so afraid. but the fact of the matter is, is that, is that the job that we’re here to do is to learn how to live in a way that we’re not terrified all the time. and not in a position of using all kinds of different things, and using people to keep that kind of terror at bay. that is my personal opinion.addendum: both lipsky and wallace were huge tv-watchers, with a section on how both can easily watch tv for 6-8 hours straight - is it just me or has that died? i know no-one who can watch that much tv without doing anything else, i can't watch tv alone for longer than 10 minutes before i open my laptop. changing times?whole bunch of disjoint (embellished?) stories about the various crazy housemates the author lived with in his ~10 years of house-sharing around the 1980s/1990s. a bit of a "cult classic" in australia, but nothing that will change your outlook on life or anything, a bunch of crazy stories, nothing more, nothing less.humankind discovers a close neutron star where extreme gravity rules, and intelligent (small) life has developed. since the star spins so fast, "time" on the star progresses faster for the lifeforms - about 15 human minutes are one of their generation. a large part of the book focuses on the developments on the planet, and how the cheela develop from stone age-like warriors to space-travellers surpassing humans. this is hard sf with a focus on physics, and by hard i mean hard to the point of unreadable:the cables became longer and longer and started to react to the magnetic field lines of the star, which were whipping by them ten times a second—five sweeps of a positive magnetic field emanating from the east pole of the neutron star, interspersed with five sweeps of the negative magnetic field from the west pole.(other science is kind of bollocks though - why is their dna-equivalent triple-stranded? why is their math apparently base 10 when (iirc) they have 12 appendixes and 12 eyes?) there's a couple of really cool ideas, for example when humans (unaware of intelligent life at that point) start to use lasers for a few minutes to map the planet, the beings on the surface quickly develop a religion around the lasers. makes you realize that your smallest actions can have huge consequences somewhere else.as it's normal with hard sf, all characters are made out of cardboard, just there to progress the story. but what's up with all women being "beautiful"? are people not allowed to look normal? it's kind of creepy to have the woman's beauty described every time she says something intelligent. men apparently don't have looks in this world.recommended for: friends of sfnot recommended for: everyone elsenot an especially easy read, but reminded me a lot of eiji yoshikawa's historical fiction - this book details the last hundred years of the roman republic, the dictatorship of sulla, the rise of the triumvirate, civil war, and how augustus (caesar's son) saved rome . since it's a history book, there are no characters or no dialogue - it's a bit like reading a summary of game of thrones stuck on fast-forward. there are intrigues, murders, back-room deals, affairs, discussions, more murders, civil war, famous philosophers, stupidly rich people, fun quirks (only bavarians drink milk or eat sitting up!), and more.i can't really say how accurate it is, since the majority of my knowledge of the time involves one fat and one tiny frenchman, but it certainly is interesting, if not at times confusing for the large number of protagonists. it's also fun to match the values of rome to some current superpowers:enthusiasts for empire argued that rome had a civilising mission; that because her values and institutions were self-evidently superior to those of barbarians, she had a duty to propagate them; that only once the whole globe had been subjected to her rule could there be a universal peace. morality had not merely caught up with the brute of imperial expansion, but wanted more.remind you of someone?  well, all possible antagonists were dead.left me completely cold - i didn't care for any of the characters, didn't care what happened to anyone (except the "crazy" guy who briefly pops up in the third part), and i'm not sure why i didn't care about what happened here.botanist/engineer is stranded on mars, becomes space macguyver, survives one and a half years on his own, is rescued/rescues himself.i'm torn what to make of this, let me list good and bad things:the good things:- this is extremely well-researched, to the point that many readers will be put off by the math (example: i have x potatoes and new ones grow every y days, and each potato gives me n calories, how long can i survive?) or by the chemistry (example: i have rocket fuel, how much water can i make from that and exactly how?). how the main character survives his time and all of the setbacks is great, and it's no wonder this has been optioned for a movie.- how the main character deals with setbacks and repurposes the stuff at his disposal is oddly motivational - what the internet nowadays calls "the hacker spirit"the bad things:- the writing. especially the first five to ten chapters are grating - the majority of the book is written in the form of a journal/log, but it's written more like the livejournal of a teenager than a mission's log. some quotes:holy shit this is awesome! holy shit! holy shit! ok calm. calm.orlong story short, i can trick the regulator in to pulling all the oxygen out of the hab. then i can wear a spacesuit (so i can breathe) and do whatever i want without fear of blowing up. yay!ortomorrow night, i'll sink to an all new low! lemme rephrase that... tomorrow night, i'll be at rock bottom! no, that doesn't sound good either... tomorrow night, i'll be in giovanni schiaparelli's favorite hole! ok, i admit i'm just fucking around now.to me, that's jarring and catapults me out of the story. i realize that others don't feel that way.- the characters. all of them one-dimensional (apparently a given in science-fiction?), most of them without much reaction to their perils - stuck on mars? let's make fart jokes. someone's dead? let's mope but actually just continue with everything else. if you can put up with livejournal writing, don't mind cardboard characterization and are into science, then this is the book for you. others beware.spoilers!a mix of baudolino and foucault's pendulum - from baudolino it has the meticulously researched historical background (except for the main character, all figures existed, and all of their strange writing did, too), from foucault's pendulum the conspiracy theories, except that this one focuses more on freemasons and jews than templars.the story itself is great - the reader follows the exploits of the fictitious master forger simone simonini who works for various secret services and is similar to baudolino involved in some of the major events of italian and french history; with garibaldi's italian campaign (with a cameo from dumas), he is the forger behind the protocols of the elders of zion as well as the note that started the dreyfus affair, he's practically the only force behind european anti-semitism, even though he himself isn't a very big anti-semite, he just concentrates the opinions of others.i'm pretty sure 90% of the historical jokes went above my head. the book is best in simonini's ethical gymnastics (as in, 'i don't forge documents, i create documents that should have existed in the first place') and various murderous shenanigans.the rather convoluted structure of the novel, with one narrator summarizing a diary held jointly by the master forger simonini and a priest who may or may not be simonini, didn't add anything to the novel at all (to me).still worlds better than the mysterious flame of queen loana.recommended for: fans of historical fiction, eco is still the best at that.not recommended for: people with zero knowledge of european history, i guess it'll get confusing fast.p.s.: you have to choose where you read this, i'm pretty sure it's weird when your seat neighbour on the bus reads pagelong rants about how the jews are behind everythinghave you ever seen the room? if not, just watch this scene. needless to say, it's great: "oh hi mark!". if you ever wondered how that movie came to be, here's the disaster artist, by one of the movie's co-stars: greg sestero (who's mark in the above scene). did you know it cost 6 million dollars? did you know it took forever to film? did you know wiseau kept on forgetting basic sentences he himself wrote? did you know still no-one really knows where all this money came from? did you know wiseau is as weird in real life as he is in the movie?here sestero describes how he met wiseau at acting school, how he tried to get his acting career to start, his continuing friendship with wiseau (and absolute bafflement about wiseau, the alien/vampire/dork?), culminating in wiseau making the room, and the absolute trainwreck of the filming, which form the main part of the book. it's also the funniest.the best thing about this book is that sestero could have taken the low road of just making fun of wiseau's absolute weirdness, and it would have destroyed the book. but instead, we get introspective sentences like this:in the end, the phenomenon of the room has allowed me to realize that, in life, anything is possible. the room is a drama that is also a comedy that is also an existential cry for help that is finally a testament to human endurance. it has made me reconsider what defines artistic success or failure. if art is expression, can it fail? is success simply a matter of what one does with failure? but it's also funny:“tommy, don’t hurt my son.”the worst thing tommy could do in response to this request, i thought, would be to chuckle creepily. “i would not,” tommy said, chuckling creepily. recommended for: fans of the movie. fans of strange humans.not recommended for: this guy (source)addendum: i'm now convinced that wiseau is a vampire, who else would say sentences like this?“this park is perfect place for vampire,” tommy said, looking around happily. “i think vampire from alcatraz live here.”  or this one:“how do you always do that?” i asked him.“do what?”“know exactly when to wake up.”“vampire trick,” tommy said.sestero brushes the vampire jokes aside but it explains so much! wiseau is a vampire who slept for a 1000 years, which would explain why he doesn't understand humans at all, why he has so much money (the gold from some transylvanian castle), why he's so pale, his accent: no-one speaks his vague eastern european accent since everyone who ever spoke that accent is dead! the book gets even better if you pretend that wiseau actually is a vampire: "interview with a vampire with a severe lack of social skills".a very good summary of the life of grace hopper, the third programmer ever, creator of the first compiler a-0 and its subsequent versions a-1 and a-2, driving force behind making programming languages more pseudo-english (instead of mathematical script), possibly inventor of comments in programming (she wrote mathematical formulas with pencil on the punched cards that were fed to the computers), ex-alcoholic, teacher, navy-woman, co-inventor of "debugging" ("bug" was already a word for problems earlier, but debugging became literal when a moth caused a breakdown in an early computer), always a force to make computing more open to the public.some parts feature less of hopper and more of "the invention of the information age", especially those with aiken, where hopper as a "character" takes a step back. she had an interesting style of invention - during her wartime work, necessity was the mother of invention ("we need these bombing tables and we need them yesterday", so sub-routines were invented so several problems could be attacked at once), but after it, much of her work was inspired by making programming easier and more accessible - less formulas, more english, and a ton of teaching to get more people into programming. a very inspiring story. there are other very interesting parts here - in describing hopper's way of "distributed invention" i was often reminded of raymond's "the cathedral and the bazaar", her work was immediately shared with the community of programmers and mathematicians and their ideas were implemented ("bazaar"-style invention, here called "distributed invention") which led to many improvements in a-1 and a-2. on the other hand, her work in the committee that designed cobol was more of a "cathedral" situation - a top-down committee of experts that first wrote the standard, then implemented the language.other parts reminded me of brooks' "the mythical man month" - some of their early day "tricks" with the mark 1 computers (such as a library of subroutines so they'd have code that has been shown to work correctly, for example, the sin() function) is repeated as a tip in brooks' book. and there's only about 40 years in between!general groves, who plays a relatively important part in ray monk's biography of oppenheimer as oppenheimer's "military counterpart" at the manhattan project, re-appears here as one of hopper's bosses at remington rand. what a weird coincidence.of course, no history book wouldn't be without some ridiculously dry parts. this is definitely not "pop" history! i had to make more coffee when it came to the details of which committee did what and how their roles were defined, who sat at which position etc. during the creation of cobol.recommended for: people interested in the history of computing or computersnot recommended for: people who don't get a laugh out of this picturedashiel hammett meets hp lovecraft; stories are mostly about p.i.s/lawmen encountering the unspeakable/indescribable/insane horror. the lawmen are usually "failed" characters, rough men who start the day with a swig from the whiskey bottle; the horror is, as with lovecraft, "from beyond reality" and likes to eat.a few stories stand out - one's interesting in that it describes a helper (or maybe even part) of these "beyond" forces, and not just the usual "human encounters monstrous entity, looses sanity and is swallowed whole". another story with an "industry espionage detective" first dragged on forever and it felt like barron wanted to go into cyberpunk territory, but then turned 180 degrees and became a horror story that reminded me more of barker's hellraiser (chains! blood! torture!) than lovecraft's stuff. some old horror-clichés abound too - one story features a character "understanding" thus plucking out his eye-balls, something that appeared in lovecraft/barker/king.just like with lovecraft, the atmosphere is great, but you can't read these stories in one go: it gets tiring.recommended for: lovecraft fans. horror fans.not recommended for: squeamish people. people who dislike predictable endings.a private investigator gets his arm chopped off with a cleaver, cauterizes the wound by himself, shoots the attacker. a christian sect that specializes in mutilation/amputation thinks highly of him for that; after all, their members only get their parts chopped off by doctors under local anesthesia. they hire him to (supposedly) solve the murder of their head honcho, a guy who cut off most of his body. lots and lots and lots of amputees are featured. lots of stuff is amputated. later, a different christian sect appears, who are also kind of about self-mutilation. a lot of people are shot. a head is paraded around (which reminded me of the 90s game shadow warrior for some reason). lots of people are shot. more people are cleaved up. the end.it's detective noir + a bit of (non-supernatural) horror + splatter; not everyone's cup of tea. reminded me, in parts, more of a comic-book than a detective book. features one of my pet peeves prominently: i hate it when one or two blows to the head knock out people, and that one happens here maybe 20 times.tl;dr:(part of a conscious effort to read books about "adults" and in the process hopefully become more of an "adult", whatever that is)things i learned from this book:1. working at amazon isn't much fun, in fact it's kind of terrifyingpeople left and afterward they took a breath and felt disoriented, like they had escaped a cult. though they didn’t share it openly, many just couldn’t take working for bezos any longer. he demanded more than they could possibly deliver and was extremely stingy with praise. at the same time, many felt a tremendous loyalty to bezos and would later marvel at how much they accomplished at amazon. kim rachmeler shared a favorite quote she heard from a colleague around that time. “if you’re not good, jeff will chew you up and spit you out. and if you’re good, he will jump on your back and ride you into the ground.”ormanagers in departments of fifty people or more are required to “top-grade” their subordinates along a curve and must dismiss the least effective performers. as a result of this ongoing examination, many amazon employees live in perpetual fear. a common experience among amazon workers is a feeling of genuine surprise when one receives a good performance review. managers are so parsimonious with compliments that underlings tend to spend their days anticipating their termination.(but: i used to work under similar "screamy" people, so i learned to just ignore their tantrums, so all fine on that front?)2. but it can also be inspiring and apparently you learn heaps :“jeff does a couple of things better than anyone i’ve ever worked for,” dalzell says. “he embraces the truth. a lot of people talk about the truth, but they don’t engage their decision-making around the best truth at the time. “the second thing is that he is not tethered by conventional thinking. what is amazing to me is that he is bound only by the laws of physics. he can’t change those. everything else he views as open to discussion.”3. and since amazon has become such a huge market-power, they've behaved more than dodgy (and bezos' sayings like "customer first" sound hollow)amazon had an easy way to demonstrate its market power. when a publisher did not capitulate and the company shut off the recommendation algorithms for its books, the publisher’s sales usually fell by as much as 40 percent. “typically it was about thirty days before they’d come back and say, ouch, how do we make this work?” says christopher smith, a senior book buyer at the time.4. several passages reminded me of inside scientology, in the description of "jeff bots", people who try to emulate bezos in thinking and behaviour tcoming close to hubbard's sea org:“jeff was learning as he went along. he learned things from each of us who had expertise and incorporated the best pieces into his mental model. now everyone is expected to think as much as they can like jeff.” bezos’s top executives are always modeling bezos-like behavior. so would i recommend this book? i learned that amazon had more failures than successes, which is good to know - in retrospect it all looks like one huge success story. it also explains recent developments like amazon's drone program, bezos isn't scared of having far-out ideas and then pursuing them relentlessly. one thing that scares me is the similarity to apple's steve jobs - both not really nice people to work under, and both willing to bend and break ethics to get what they wanted. "some" people see that as the reason for their success and try to emulate this behaviour. you can be extremely successful and not sell your soul - look at norman borlaug, father of the green revolution, also founder of the mexican softball league, who made sure that all of his "lower level" employees received university education. or look at valve's steve gaben, who gives sick employees the official job-title of "getting better" and pays them until they are ok again. bezos doesn't even pay parking fees. yay for australian english: mixing data-structures and language since 1901addendum:where does success come from? it seems that most of the current silicon valley higher-ups had very good childhoods, with special schools, extremely early access to computers, special schooling programs for gifted children, etc. look at bill gates or jeff bezos. at the same time, their adult versions worked extremely hard, much more than 99% of the rest of the world, and of course had luck at the right time, and were uncompromising in their "big thinking". all of these things?a strange novella - narrator meets amazingly depressed woman, both sign up for a marathon dancing contest for food and shelter, dance for a month or so until the contest is aborted. woman constantly wants to die. man shoots woman on the bidding of the woman. the end. could've made a good nirvana concept album.more like two separate books of short-stories than one - the first half is "spooky" stories from other reviewers say these are the pinnacle of "weird fiction", but to me they're quite tame, definitely due to their old age. if you like me grew up in germany, these stories are 100% "gespentergeschichten", nothing too harsh. look at this cover, that's how the stories are like:example: the narrator and his female friend keep on dreaming of a pale guy, both spot him in reality (he's a guard at a nearby graveyard), one night he attacks them in their dreams (or in reality?), the man defends himself but the woman dies. turns out, the pale guy has been dead for far longer! wow, much spooky! in other words: seltsam? aber so steht es geschrieben...the second half is all about young americans in paris living the bohemian artist's life, and that half is actually better. the story about the naive young american falling in love with a prostitute, not realizing what her work is, and her being too ashamed to tell him - that was the highlight of the entire collection.without the second half i would've given it two stars.recommended for: people who want to know where lovecraft got some of his stuff from. people who like paris.not recommended for: everyone else.i read the edition from ebooks@adelaide here.if you've been following my reviews you might have gleaned that i'm a huge fan of "sad" or "depressing" books - and this one's right up my alley!three novels, but together they tell one story, of twins during ww2 and afterwards in a (probably) communist satellite state, city or country names are never mentioned, but i'd wager it's hungary since the author is from there. the twins are deserted, people die, people "get disappeared" under the regime, no-one is ever happy. the first book was the strongest; narrated by the twins themselves, using extremely reduced and spare language, it's often shocking how desensitized both have made themselves to their surroundings. the spare language makes the brutality machine-like. due to the brutality and suffering, which is contradicted by the twins' "genius" and "otherworldliness" (they're a bit like the children in village of the damned) the first book feels more like a bleak fairytale, the second and third books are not as bleak (people actually have names in these!) and the third book even has something of a twist.the two things i copied from this book: 'i say, "yes. no book, no matter how sad, can be as sad as a life."' and "i tell him that life is totally useless, that it's nonsense, an aberration, infinite suffering, the invention of a non-god whose evil surpasses understanding."bonus fact: the famous japanese super nintendo roleplaying game mother 3 is partially based on the first book.the pessimist’s credo, or one of them, is that nonexistence never hurt anyone and existence hurts everyone.remember when you were 16 and you thought too much about life and its implications that you wound up in a "dark valley", got so depressed and borderline-suicidal that you decided to leave the "valley" and never look back? thomas ligotti has built himself a nice house in that valley.to summarize the thesis of this non-fiction book/treatise: being alive is not alright, optimists are deceiving themselves and others, the future will not be better, the creation of consciousness was a huge mistake, life is useless and painful to boot, and humanity would do itself a favor by collectively deciding to not have children anymore: to stop perpetuate this madness. to quote:consciousness makes it seem as if (1) there is something to do; (2) there is somewhere to go; (3) there is something to be; (4) there is someone to know. this is what makes consciousness the parent of all horrors, the thing that makes us try to do something, go somewhere, be something, and know someone, such as ourselves, so that we can escape our malignantly useless being and think that being alive is all right rather than that which should not be. (yes, malignantly useless is always capitalized)orbeef, pork, sometimes goat—they go into us and come out of us. this is part of the regimen of nonsense that nature forced upon us. but it is not all the nonsense we must endure as we go to and fro on the earth and walk up and down upon it. the nature nonsense, the god nonsense. how much nonsense can we take in our lives? and is there any way we can escape it? no, there is not. we are doomed to all kinds of nonsense: the pain nonsense, the nightmare nonsense, the sweat and slave nonsense, and many other shapes and sizes of insufferable nonsense. it is brought to us on a plate, and we must eat it up or face the death nonsense.he quotes extensively from zapffe, schopenhauer, mainländer, lovecraft (awesome) and others to make his case - sometimes, the book feels more like an expansion of zapffe's ideas... neither zapffe nor mainländer were known to me before; i guess both are reasonably unknown, since the majority of zapffe's work remains untranslated.but: there is a dark strange form of humor at work here; reading the book i couldn't help but think that getting drunk with ligotti must be great fun.you do see that he's got a background as a horror writer:we are aberrations—beings born undead, neither one thing nor another, or two things at once … uncanny things that have nothing to do with the rest of creation, horrors that poison the world by sowing our madness everywhere we go, glutting daylight and darkness with incorporeal obscenities.recommended for: remember the nietzsche quote, "when you gaze long into an abyss the abyss also gazes into you"? this book is for people who love getting into staring contests with the abyss.not recommended for: psychologically labile people. teddy daniels from shutter island. me at age 16.best sf i've read since dune.less about gender than i had expected from things i read on the internet - often more about how hard it is to communicate with a society even if you can speak the language. reminded me a bit of lem in that regard, even though in lem's worlds communication is often completely impossible.not sure what i think of this - two books in one, the first about the metaphors of cancer and tuberculosis, the second one about the metaphors of aids. both books seem to be worried about the militarization of the treatment of both cancer and aids, as in "the war on cancer"/"the war on aids" and all that follows of these ways of thinking (including calls for internment of hiv-positive people etc.).the first book on tuberculosis/cancer is more outdated than the second - i rarely encounter many points it refutes, much of which was spread in the early to mid 19th european literature, for example, that cancer is due to (paraphrased) someone not really being in contact with their feelings. i think only hippies still believe that. it's also weird that the book so often refutes points made by georg groddeck and wilhelm reich, both of which are now mostly known for their crazy ideas and not much else (i remember a poor soul who had to hold a talk about groddeck's "the book of the it" in high school german, to the general amusement of everyone - i mean, "you break your leg only if you want to?" what is that)the second book on aids is better, but contains a bit of repetition from the first one (since both were published several years apart). recommended for: skeptics who want to see someone refute common beliefs of their time. someone who's looking for a quick non-fiction read, it's only 200 pages or so.not recommended for: the rest of the world.this is my new "go to" recommendation for people looking to get into the field. i would not recommend it to biologists or those without any programming experience - for that, it assumes to much of the reader - but for programmers thinking of going into bioinformatics, or bioinformaticians who've dabbled a bit with the shell, this is a gold-mine.it starts off with good advice like this one:in teaching bioinformatics, i often share this idea as the golden rule of bioinformatics: never ever trust your tools (or data) this isn’t to make you paranoid that none of bioinformatics can be trusted, or that you must test every available program and parameter on your data. rather, this is to train you to adopt the same cautious attitude software engineers and bioinformaticians have learned the hard way.and how to structure and document your projects, then a short intro to using bash, one chapter on git, a bit of ssh, working with data, various useful unix tools (you know, awk, sort etc.), a very dense introduction to r, bioconductor, genomicranges, dplyr, ggplot2 (this felt like the bulk of the book, possibly because r is the one thing i had the least experience with from the stuff in the book), an intro to some common file-formats like fasta/fastq/sam/bam and some of their related tools (samtools/bedtools), then a bit of streaming data, and closing with a quick introduction to sql using sqlite. all of that crammed into ~300 pages! it's a dense book.luckily he introduces only the "timeless" stuff, the tools that should still be around in a few years. there's no introduction to read aligners here, for example, these change all the time. the tone is lively and direct and not overcomplicated, but i can't stress this enough, absolute programming beginners will struggle. for those there are other introductory books (like haddock/dunn's 'practical computing for biologists').on the other hand, if you're an advanced bioinformatician somewhere at the end of your phd or even past that much in this book may bore you; in that case, it's always nice to see how colleagues go about their work. for example, why have i always googled sam flags like some caveman instead of simply using 'samtools flags'?yet this book fills a niche that i've always wanted to see a book in - the relatively tool-agnostic, "how to go about your job in the most efficient way possible" niche.great art connects with something inside you, and there is so much that reverbates here.. all that awkward youth, moments when you had to hope your parents didn't notice you were drink, the knowledge of humans knausgard shows all over the place ("she was short and there was something duck like about her. but none of this mattered one bit in my judgement of her, for she had something else, which was more improtant: she was a focal point."). every few pages i found a part of myself in this book, maybe because i had a similar youth as knausgard  - things like the deadness of the small town he grew up in, it's weird how he writes how i, and a lot of other people, feel about my hometown; things like his complicated non-relationship with parents, in his case his father (who takes up most of the book, and it seems like, most of the space in knausgard's head, too).on the other hand, i can see how this might not be fun for many people - there's so much meandering going on in the book, as an example, knausgard remembers that he used to sleepwalk and bam, the entire family's history of sleepwalking is described, there's no escape. so if you're looking for a logical story, you should look somewhere else - too much is happening here for that, knausgard crams a level of detail in this that it's no wonder there are five more books, with a combined count of 3500 pags. will i read all of these? maybe, i got about 60 years of life left, why not.sidenote: this is how i imagine all scandinavians are like:"mom and i have decided to separate", he said. "what?" i said."yes, but it won't affect you . besides, you're not a child anymore and in two years you'll be moving to a place of your own.""yes, that's true," i sad."okay?" dad asked."okay," i said.feelings: ¯\_(ツ)_/¯ well, i was way less cool - no bands, no making out at parties, more lans, more hohlbein booksreminds me a lot of the last policeman, except that here it's radiation fallout spread by wind with a "date of arrival" and in the last policeman it's a meteorite, but both are reasonably similar - people hang on to their old lives as much as possible before the inevitable happens. some go a tiny bit crazy and go on races, most just try to live their life as normal as possible.recommended for: post-apoc fans. people who like the british stiff upper lip.not recommended for: people who believe that impending doom will turn everyone into mad max.not sure about this book, i don't seem to get it. maybe because i grew up in germany? do we have different childhoods? i don't think so..here we have charlie, a highly intelligent, slightly mentally ill 15-year old (later 16) who writes letters about his daily life. since he's so intelligent he hangs out with the older crowd, a couple of 17/18-year olds at his high-school. the first half of the book was bad. charlie doesn't think like a 15-year old, he and his friends think like mature, respectful 30-year olds. the biggest concern to me was the total and absolute lack of awkwardness, which to me is the major feeling of that certain age: most kisses at that age are "he stuck his tongue so deep into my throat that i threw up" , here kisses are beautiful and perfect moments forever stuck in time. most social events at that age are "she's young, she can't judge drinking, she drank so much jägermeister in 20 minutes that she threw up on me" , in this book they are gatherings of like-minded artists who read each other poetry. that is the worst part - everyone is such a unique quirky snowflake (we discuss the smiths! we read poetry! we make punk zines! we drive pickups! we drink brandy!); no-one is really a character, everyone is just there to allude to pop culture. of course there has to be a gay couple there as well, they're not gay because of the way the characters are but they are gay so that the book can be oh-so-progressive. it reminded me a lot of the movie juno, where similarly everybody is quirky for quirkiness' sake.the second half got better: chbosky perfectly captures the moment when your childhood friendships dissolve and everybody starts their own life; you get nostalgic for that time. but then you realize that he knows he inflicts these emotions, you feel that he constructed this not to write "the truth" but to toy with your emotions, and that is when you feel like taking a shower. after i finished the book i would've given it 3 or 4 stars mainly because of these scenes; now a day later the effect has worn off, luckily. on the language: some of these one-off sentences like "at this moment, we felt infinite" feel painfully cheesy like coelho, it's not even funny. disclaimer: never happened to me disclaimer: happened to mewarning: reading this book will make you angry.the first half chronicles the history of scientology, from hubbard's early days as a struggling sf writer (mostly for the money), to the rise and subsequent fall of dianetics, the re-invention of the concept as scientology, and the drift into paranoid madness of hubbard. then the book goes over to the coup d'etat by the current boss david miscavige, details the death of lisa mcpherson and the personal role of miscavige in it, the "star power" strategy of scientology (you know, tom cruise, john travolta, surprisingly to me: nancy cartwright, the voice of bart simpson), and concludes with the current rise of splinter-groups who agree with hubbard's teaching but don't agree with how the church is handled.what will make you angry is the "evil" (for lack of a better term) done by the church or its followers. the harassment of irs-personnel to get a "tax exempt" status, the harassment of ex-members, the non-relenting suing of everyone not agreeing with scientology, the creepiness of hubbard and miscavige (hubbard had a personal staff of 15-year old girls as "messengers" who ran his errands for him, held his drinks, lighted his cigarettes etc. - miscavige regularly beats people up and plays cruel mind-games, like forcing all of his staff to play "around the world or they're 'out'", which leads to physical fights between people for chairs), the shameful story of mcpherson's death (miscavige personally declared her "clear" so a nervous breakdown should be impossible, but she suffered a nervous breakdown, since that wasn't possible they kept her under wraps and didn't give her much medical help. she died of dehydration which the church immediately started to cover up. the coroner changed her report later  so that the organization didn't get sued). so much more: the weirdness of the whole tom cruise-involvement is worth to read this book alone.it makes you happy that germany officially sees scientology as a cult.it was a bit discomforting to read that some of my fav. golden age sf writers like ae van vogt were early dianetics-followers, but i expected that from the more crazier authors like burroughs (or even guys like manson). also surprised to see that the nation of islam (malcolm x's church for half of his life until they kicked him out, see his auto-biography) has moved closer and closer to scientology, they're now teaching dianetics.the only positive things i took away from the book is that currently, scientology is bleeding high-level members because miscavige treats everyone like the complete sociopath he seems to be, and that scientology has less members than i thought - by one count in 2008, 25,000 in the us.recommended for: those who need more proof that the most damage is done by people who think they're doing "good". those who still believe in people.not recommended for: people with blood pressure problems, may induce heart attack.a lot of fun and the kind of book i wish i had read earlier, at, let's say, around 16? contains immense respect and love towards humans, especially women. and it's fun!recommended for: people who visit reddit's redpill, so they can see what they're missing, stuck in their weird worldview.that great empire crumbled and fell apart. first, afghanistan, then chernobyl....it was more like a conspiracy of ignorance and obedience. the principle of their lives, the one thing the party machine had taught them, was never to stick their necks out. better to keep everyone happy....i thought that a waste burial site was a complex, engineered construction, but it turned out to be an ordinary pit. we picked up the earth and rolled it, like big rugs. we'd pick up the whole green mass of it, with grass, flowers, roots. and bugs, and spiders, worms. it was work for madmen. you can't just pick up the whole earth, take off everything living. if we weren't drinking like crazy every night, i doubt we’d have been able to take it....they had to cut up the formal wear, too, because they couldn’t get it on him, there wasn't a whole body to put it on. it was all—wounds. the last two days in the hospital—i’d lift his arm, and meanwhile the bone is shaking, just sort of dangling, the body has gone away from it. pieces of his lungs, of his liver, were coming out of his mouth. he was choking on his internal organs. i’d wrap my hand in a bandage and put it in his mouth, take out all that stuff. it's impossible to talk about.do you remember that over-the-top drug dude from a scanner darkly?this book is what it would have been like if that dude became a heisenberg-like genius drug cook who lost his memory and has to slowly piece it all back together. sometimes hard to read since the narrator is beyond "unreliable" and the language becomes very poetic, but it's still entertaining. yet i probably will forget this book in 2 months."time is a flat circle, marty", especially if you're a fugitive stuck on an island stuck in two different planes of time (maybe?). i can't say more without spoiling it, and i'm afraid i might already have.recommended for fans of borges - you can clearly see the influence here, even though this book is more "realistic" than borges' writing.now i want to build my own concrete house, with air-tight windows, filters on all air-conditioning, with a vacuum room in front of it, far away from disease hotbeds like the african (or australian) jungle. my food shall be astronaut's food, prepared by sterile japanese robots working in orbit. to minimize the risk of zoonosis the surrounding area of my concrete block shall be transformed into a nice, big parking spot. under a glass dome. with an additional vacuum room/shower room in front of it. yes, you have to drive your car through that.come visit me! there's ample parking. i won't let you in though, you can knock on the windows. just don't cough in the area of my concrete block or i'll have to let the robots (cheaper alternative: undergrads, but those are filthy) scrub it all down with bleach. bring a cake. watch me burn it in the incinerator. why did you bring this disease-ridden thing to me?(only 4 stars because it sometimes gets too hyperbolic/doomsday-y for me, especially in connection with the empty ex-lab building)a mixed bag - some of these are good, some of these are terrible. the strangest thing is that so many of these stories sound as if they were written by one person, there's rarely any difference in style or voice.. weird.starts cool with some basic thinking skills that everyone can use in every situation (starting with basic stuff like occam's razor) - then it becomes a bit boring when dennett summarizes his own research/work of the last 40 years or so, about free will/determinism/consciousness etc. if you're not into these three (and i'm not really), then you can skip this book. the stuff about evolution is nice but nothing particularly new for most biologists.here's some rambling.a history of 'the outsider', the person who wants to 'live more abundantly', sees reality as unreal, sees himself outside of society, full of people that are 'asleep'. the outsider is alone. wilson describes the definition and the problems of the outsider by using literature (particularly hesse, and a great re-interpretation of dostoevsky's lifework) and the lives of a few outsiders like t.e. lawrence, van gogh and the ballet dancer nijinsky. to wilson, all of these men failed at their task of 'solving' the problems of the outsider. some committed 'mind-suicide' by turning away from these questions, some like hesse died before they could finish their path, others like nietzsche or nijinsky went crazy , others like van gogh killed themselves. you see, it's not an easy path.the book is about 60 years old, but its main questions are still valid and as unsolved as they were back then. it seems the work on these questions died together with the counter-culture of the 70s. a few contemporary writers (such as bret easton ellis or tao lin) touch on the themes of the outsider's alienation, but then immediately coil back and devolve into a numbing: mindless sex, drugs, etc.if you've felt yourself as an 'outsider', then this book is for you. wilson published it when he was just 24 , i believe people older than that could not have written a similar book. maybe i just found my niche in society and stopped thinking so much about the absurdity of it all? have i, like t. e. lawrence, committed mind-suicide?i'm not the biggest fan of his path towards a solution of these problems, which he apparently developed more in subsequent books; it's too much religion, too much mysticism for me (for example: is there a realization of the self, or is it just self-deceit, a replacement for a purpose in life? i don't even think the 'self' exists, something which wilson sometimes touches on , but then immediately goes back to assuming that the 'self' is a thing, and therefore, a 'higher' level of life is possible. i'm not really convinced that is possible in the first place.).anyway, these problems still exist, they haven't magically dissolved in clouds of logic. it's a shame that we as a society have just covered the outsider's problems in layers of irony to pretend they don't exist (in that point, david foster wallace was absolutely right). there's an interesting anecdote in the book - when nijinsky went crazy, he stood in the middle of the street with a cross, asking people if they had found jesus - a man informed his wife, he had witnessed nietzsche doing exactly the same thing 10 years before, when nietzsche went crazy. impressive how many books, writers, ideas he cites; and for how many writers he has strong opinions (dostoevsky, for example, is a 'shoddy craftsman'). i'm now 4 years older and i haven't even read half of these books.sometimes, when you read too much about hubbard and scientologists being creepy, you have to clink out and read some golden age sf.this one's actually a lot of fun: terrans (why never "earth"?) are at war with the sirians, who are technologically behind but make that up in bigger numbers (gee, i wonder on which political conflict of the 1950s this is based). a human is sent to one of the outer sirian planets to stir things up. the protagonist is sent with unlimited money and advanced tech to impersonate an entire rebel army by distributing propaganda, killing people, bombing people etc. there is no moral in here since sirians are others and the ones he kills are always overtly characterized as being "evil", no ambiguity there. how he succeeds at his terrorist mission is at times fun and at times surprisingly well-thought out.without spoilering too much, the ending is actually exactly like i would imagine such a story in real life to end. no overtly heroic stuff, that was unexpected from books of the era - you would expect the guy with the chiseled chin to ride off into the sunset with the love of his life.of course, since it's golden age sf the protagonist is one-dimensional (feelings are boring, characters are boring, let's have more story), overpowered (unlimited money! advanced technology!), lucky when the plot demands it etc.recommended for: terrorists who think that blowing themselves up is ineffective and need better ideas. friends of "classic" sf. it's fun for an afternoon.three bodies are found mutilated in gorky park, and arkady renko, chief investigator, has to solve the murder.reminded me a lot of qui xialong's crime novels set in communist china; most of the investigation work isn't spend on looking for the murder, but to appease the political parties involved, and most of the main figure's brainpower is devoted to navigating politics. the inspector is a 1-to-1 transposition of the american noir detective to soviet russia; he has problems with authority, gets beaten up constantly, figures most things out only after it's too late, can't win against the forces higher than him (remember "forget it, jake. it's chinatown."), his life is a mess (remember wallander?), it's all a bit of a cliché by now.it could have done without the weird, confused, tacked on ending in the us. i don't know how accurate it is in the portrayal of soviet life.just beautiful; reading this is how dancing feels like.you start by wanting justice and you end up organizing the police.pretty cool introductory course over all the things "data science" does nowadays, i.e., mostly data cleaning, machine learning, prediction etc. it's good to see that the authors spend so much time talking about the pitfalls of dirty data, how important it is to be skeptical of the model's output, overfitting, correlation != causation and much more; much stuff i've read so far just focuses on how the model is used, not how the model is interpreted.this book will certainly not turn you into a data scientists, but it will a) give you starting points for most common tasks (in other words, when someone will ask you for a fairly robust classification method, you might think of random forests or k-nn after this book). plus, it gives you lots of books for each of the sub-fields to further your studies.my biggest annoyance is the constant love for google, like every 50 pages or so google is mentioned and how great it is to work there, and how fun it is to work on google+ etc. pp.things you need to know before reading: - math: you should know what the common symbols like sigma means, and be able to solve some equations- how to read programs: most of the book's code is in r, with a bit of python, and 4 or 5 lines of go. you definitely need to understand programming to understand these examples, but the authors encourage readers to come up with their own in response to the exercise at hand.when it came time to get drafted into the german army i wrote a nice letter saying that war is crap and i'd never touch a weapon in order to get out of the army (and into the civil service). as such, i assumed i wouldn't connect with this book as i personally had no clue about what war's like, and after reading i'm pretty sure i'm not the target audience at all, but it was still so interesting.it's a surprisingly spiritual book about how the us treats its soldiers, how soldiers see themselves and how soldiers are mistreated, based on marlantes experiences in the vietnam war. the book draws a lot from joseph campbell's stuff on myths and symbolism (campbell appears several times in the book) but most of it you can still see as just being symbolic - just because marlantes talks about the god mars doesn't mean he himself believes that such a god exists, it's just his way to explain the "inner warrior". i guess it's geared towards the us public and towards decision makers - war is exhilarating which is a taboo to talk about, but it's also terrible to see your friends die, and for marlantes there are simply not enough rituals inside the army and for returning veterans to help them cope in order to get back into society.it's one of the more brutally honest books i've read about war.the only drawbacks: sometimes the spiritualism is too heavy handed for me, and sometimes it falls into really antiquated gender roles (no wonder when you base it on "gods" or a symbol of those - fertility gods are female, war gods are male).this is surprisingly good - rare to see a book this full of symbolism and foreshadowing. the only problem is that these parts are excruciatingly boring - the first quarter of the book is literally nothing but rich people customizing their garden (with added symbolism), then it becomes interesting once the despair sets in, only to get back to people standing around simulating old pictures (which goes on for way too long), then it gets interesting again.goethe was great at characterization without judging - especially eduard (the ~40 year old main guy) comes off as a spoiled child, but goethe doesn't beat the reader over the head with it. of course he then falls in love with the childish girl.and it's fun to see how many commas fit into a sentence in german, the average must be around 8.a depressing summary of the 'death by a thousand cuts' of us society, from the beginning of the death of the manufacturing industry, to the housing bubble, to the global financial crisis, to occupy wall street. luckily it's not a dry manifesto - it's rather three stories of 'normal' americans interwoven in chapters, together with single chapters on various americans who had a part, or are symbolic of, the unwinding of america and its social structures .it's a good warning for other countries - australia's housing boom is less like a gold-rush, but similarly unmaintainable , politicians all over the world (for example, the fdp in germany) want to remove even more restrictions on finance. nothing has changed for the us, more financial crises are coming. it's a depressing, but important book. the guy trying for decades to convert seed oil into biodiesel makes me happy to work in brassica genomics  i once lived in one of these weird american-style exurbs in australia. copy-pasted townhouses from my house to the horizon, no social life, no city centre except a huge plastic shopping centre, no neighbours to see, no-one walking on the streets, it's depressing and feels more like mars than earth.a beautiful little gem of a book, based on the religious love for all kinds of literature. read it, it just takes 2 hours. and then re-read it.lots of people love & hype this book, the life story of a doctor who makes it from france to africa to the us and back to france. it's often rambling, written in a very colloquial tone, almost like you're sitting in a beer and there's this weird old drunk who's tired of life just talking and talking and talking. (it reminds me of a guy i had with me on the bus on a trip through spain - he was spanish, spoke fluent german, it was 9am and he was coked up to the roof of his head, smelled like a bar and said that he'd been up for three days ; he alternated between "man here everything's a big party" and "i wish god would kill me instead of a child, i'm tired of living")but i don't know, i'm just tired of ennui, cynicism and irony in literature; since this book came out a million others have tried to copy the style, and now i can't stand this anymore. i guess a case of "seinfeld is unfunny".i missed these long, sprawling sentencesa history of modern genomics with a foray into a relatively new field, synthetic biology, here venter summarizes his work on microbial genomes, later on the human genome and on creating new life out of existing microbes. he's a great writer when it comes to scientific details, i wouldn't hesitate to recommend this book to high school students interested in going into the field, or lay people interested in recent developments. did you know venter was involved in the development of expressed sequence tags (ests)? i didn't, and yet i used them in my bsc-thesis!some people (creationists?) might be put off by his very mechanistic view, proteins are machines, dna is software, cells are assembly lines. i'm not.in short: 2.5, lovecraft + bofh + hellboy + dilbertsometimes, you find a book clearly written by the author for her/himself. this is one of these books - set in a lovecraftian universe with unspeakable evil waiting out there, doing higher mathematics can open gates or call these creatures to possess you or your surroundings. there's a secret government agency charged with finding mathematicians stumbling into the wrong invocations, who promptly recruit them to protect the world. two stories - the larger one featuring nazis, alternative universes, body possession, and a shorter one featuring bureaucratic powerplays.as with accelerando (which i aborted and may need to give another chance), stross loves throwing out technical sentences that make no sense. in accelerando it was stuff like artificial neural networks behaving like ai, here it's sentences like "i fuzzed its eigenvector but good", or this one:so this thing... it's a very precise transformation through the mandelbrot set. which you guys have used as a map onto a linde continuum, right? why don't they just set up an n-dimensional homogeneous matrix transformation? it's so much more intuitively obvious."star trek's techno-babble is at least internally consistent!yet stross seems to have worked in it in a large organisation, there's quite a few people who might find this funny:harriet has been having problems with her email system and asked my advice; i don't know quite what went wrong, but she ended up blowing five days of the departmental training budget attending a course on sendmail configuration. took her three weeks to stop twitching every time somebody mentioned rules.some more "bad" things: every character speaks and behaves exactly the same, the protagonist's love interest is a nerd gibson wet-dream (hot! goth clothes! stays up all night to read knuth! etc. pp.), the protagonist just knows stuff the story needs him to know (he goes from system administrator to knowing how to defuse an atomic bomb in ~80 pages), several glaring plot-holes (why is there a experienced secret specialized anti-paranormal sas unit but all of them see magic for the first time when the protagonist uses it?), framing the holocaust as a needed sacrifice for a death spell is pretty bad taste, and more. but well, as the afterword says (weirdly defensive): "nobody forced you to read it by holding a gun to your head". i guess fans of dresden files or the martian might like this, similar humor. or system-admins who know the bofh archive by heart.p.s.: interestingly, there's a joke about gchq listening on americans while the nsa listens in on the british so both agencies can exchange intel without doing something illegal - something which was officially proven about 8 years after this book came out.i think that when i took stats during my university courses, the focus was all wrong. it was like this:here are some numbers, put them into the formula for the t-test, when the number that comes out is below 0.05 write "i reject the null hypothesis with a p-value of x". i never really learned about the basic assumptions behind this test (and all the other ones), nor did i learn about how to interpret and actually think about these results. did i make mistakes in my analysis? what are possible mistakes? what could i do better? what did i actually do there?here's a great book for exactly that set of problems - it starts off with an introduction and explanation of all the basic words and teachings of statistics (p-values, cutoffs, etc.), then goes to the basic tests (t-test, non-parametric tests, anova etc.).. each method isn't introduced from the math angle, in fact the book has maybe 5 to 10 formulas, but lists the basic assumptions of the method and what you can glance from the results.one caveat: like most statisticians, motulsky has opinions: 95% cis are more intuitive to understand than t-tests, basing analyses on smoothed data is crap, etc. might not be everyone's cup of tea. motulsky also the author of the graphprism software for statistical analysis so that one's frequently featured (example: "i made this analysis using graphpad."). to make up for that, there's an appendix on r and excel.can a book be bad that features 4 or 5 xkcd comics? can a book be bad when the author trawls amazon.com and writes bad reviews for fraudulent study guides? or who writes rad reviews about dragonball (boring reality would say that this was a child of motulsky, but i want to believe)? recommended for: scientists, decision makers, other people who regularly work with statistics.slightly recommended for: students - there might be too much high-level detail and opinion in here if you need to cram for a test, there are other books for that which focus on the actual math. but if you want to work in stats later it might be a good decision to read through this book.more a contemporary document than a novel - mostly written because orwell felt that the (inter)national press grossly misrepresented the civil war in spain and he tried to contradict the general opinions of the war. has some dry chapters full of acronyms (p.o.u.m, p.o.e., f.a.i. etc.), and orwell rightfully warns the readers before these specific chapters, but contains one of the best descriptions i've ever read on what it's like being shot in the throat ("not being in pain, i felt a vague satisfaction. this ought to please my wife, i thought; she had always wanted me to be wounded, which would save me from being killed when the great battle came etc.")guess i have to read up more on the spanish civil war! i could write a longer review about this, but for now: a prime example on "how not to write a book".review forthcoming if i can be bothered, nothing special or particularly interesting herethe autobiography of graves' life up until towards the age of 33, by which he was already a relatively famous poet (i believe nowadays he's more famous for his greek and latin translations?). there's quite a bit on growing up part of the british bourgeoisie in "public" schools, very honest about the sexual experimentation going on. he joined the army on the start of the first world war and stayed on for the majority of it, so the majority of this book also focuses on the dirty and depressing trench-life.in between all the death and injury there's a bit of catch-22 going through. on trying to get a not very stable friend out of a bind by getting him declared mentally unsound:we discussed the political situation; i took the line that everyone was mad except ourselves and one or two others, and that no good could come of offering common sense to the insane. our only possible course would be to keep on going out until we got killed.  the irony of having to argue to these mad old men that siegfried was not sane!or this very british bit after graves is hit by a shell, injured, reported dead but delivered to a hospital:i asked him: "can i have a drink?""would you like some tea?"i whispered: "not with condensed milk."he said, most apologetically: "i'm afraid there's no fresh milk."tears of disappointment pricked my eyes; i expected better of a hospital behind the lines.only the british take getting nearly killed absolutely stoic, but then start to cry because the tea-situation is bad.after the war there's a bit of life in egypt as a professor of english teaching students who barely spoke english (rather bad taste to reprint bad student essays (or imitations of these)), and lots of anecdotes on now famous writers like t.e. lawrence or ezra pound. but about three quarters focuses on ww1 - so if you're not into that, you might want to skip this book.p.s.: in the epilogue he writes disdainfully about the tourists coming to his chosen home mallorca/majorca - lucky he died before ballermann 6 (even though they've turned that place into a swanky beach lounge area now, no more sangria buckets)can't believe i only read this now - definitely in my top 10-20 books. i can see why some lawyers cite atticus as their main reason to choose that job.highly recommended, i only wish i could write this clearly, or even think this clearly. a lot about politics, propaganda and modern life (both haven't really changed since then it seems), the most impressive thing to me is that even though he nowadays counts as a socialist, he can impartially describe the follies of both left and right without falling for the lies and (self-)deceptions of either side. i don't know any "modern" (as in, currently alive) writers who can do this.as a sidenote, one can find many "famous" formulations of animal farm or 1984 in these essays before they appeared in the books.if you read one essay of his, choose this one: politics and the english language, probably the most relevant to contemporary times.i've underlined about a hundred insightful passages which i'm just going to paste here so that you can get a general idea. all others can stop here.(keep in mind that most of these essays are written 1938-1949)it seems to me a safe assumption that the disease loosely called nationalism is now almost universal. antisemitism is only one manifestation of nationalism, and not everyone will have the disease in that particular form. a jew, for example, would not be antisemitic: but then many zionist jews seem to me to be merely antisemites turned upside-down, just as many indians and negroes display the normal colour prejudices in an inverted form.but that antisemitism will be definitively cured, without curing the larger disease of nationalism, i do not believe.political or military commentators, like astrologers, can survive almost any mistake, because their more devoted followers do not look to them for an appraisal of the facts but for the stimulation of nationalistic loyalties.in 1927 chiang kai shek boiled hundreds of communists alive, and yet within ten years he had become one of the heroes of the left. the re-alignment of world politics had brought him into the anti-fascist camp, and so it was felt that the boiling of the communists ‘didn’t count’, or perhaps had not happened.pacifist: those who ‘abjure’ violence can only do so because others are committing violence on their behalfthere is no limit to the follies that can be swallowed if one is under the influence of feelings of this kind. i have heard it confidently stated, for instance, that the american troops had been brought to europe not to fight the germans but to crush an english revolution. one has to belong to the intelligentsia to believe things like that: no ordinary man could be such a fool.if you hate and fear russia, if you are jealous of the wealth and power of america, if you despise jews, if you have a sentiment of inferiority towards the british ruling class, you cannot get rid of those feelings simply by taking thought. but you can at least recognise that you have them, and prevent them from contaminating your mental processes.but what this scene, and much else that i saw in germany, brought home to me was that the whole idea of revenge and punishment is a childish daydream. properly speaking, there is no such thing as revenge. revenge is an act which you want to commit when you are powerless and because you are powerless: as soon as the sense of impotence is removed, the desire evaporates also. who would not have jumped for joy, in 1940, at the thought of seeing s.s. officers kicked and humiliated? but when the thing becomes possible, it is merely pathetic and disgusting. it is said that when mussolini’s corpseat the international level sport is frankly mimic warfare. but the significant thing is not the behaviour of the players but the attitude of the spectators: and, behind the spectators, of the nations who work themselves into furies over these absurd contests, and seriously believe — at any rate for short periods — that running, jumping and kicking a ball are tests of national virtue.serious sport has nothing to do with fair play. it is bound up with hatred, jealousy, boastfulness, disregard of all rules and sadistic pleasure in witnessing violence: in other words it is war minus the shooting.however, it appears from president truman’s remarks, and various comments that have been made on them, that the bomb is fantastically expensive and that its manufacture demands an enormous industrial effort, such as only three or four countries in the world are capable of making. this point is of cardinal importance, because it may mean that the discovery of the atomic bomb, so far from reversing history, will simply intensify the trends which have been apparent for a dozen years past.but suppose — and really this the likeliest development — that the surviving great nations make a tacit agreement never to use the atomic bomb against one another? suppose they only use it, or the threat of it, against people who are unable to retaliate? in that case we are back where we were before, the only difference being that power is concentrated in still fewer hands and that the outlook for subject peoples and oppressed classes is still more hopeless.if you plant a walnut you are planting it for your grandchildren, and who cares a damn for his grandchildren?every writer, in any case, is rather that kind of person, but the prolonged, indiscriminate reviewing of books is a quite exceptionally thankless, irritating and exhausting job. it not only involves praising trash — though it does involve that, as i will show in a moment — but constantly inventing reactions towards books about which one has no spontaneous feelings whatever.people talk about the horrors of war, but what weapon has man invented that even approaches in cruelty some of the commoner diseases? “natural” death, almost by definition, means something slow, smelly and painful.this business of people just dying like animals, for instance, with nobody standing by, nobody interested, the death not even noticed till the morning — this happened more than once.machiavelli and his followers taught that in politics decency simply does not exist, and, by doing so, burnham claims, made it possible to conduct political affairs more intelligently and less oppressively. a ruling class which recognised that its real aim was to stay in power would also recognise that it would be more likely to succeed if it served the common good, and might avoid stiffening into a hereditary aristocracy.socialism, until recently, was supposed to connote political democracy, social equality and internationalism. there is not the smallest sign that any of these things is in a way to being established anywhere, and the one great country in which something described as a proletarian revolution once happened, i.e. the ussr, has moved steadily away from the old concept of a free and equal society aiming at universal human brotherhood. in an almost unbroken progress since the early days of the revolution, liberty has been chipped away and representative institutions smothered, while inequalities have increased and nationalism and militarism have grown stronger.political predictions are usually wrong, because they are usually based on wish-thinking, but they can have symptomatic value, especially when they change abruptly.such a world-picture fits in with the american tendency to admire size for its own sake and to feel that success constitutes justification, and it fits in with the all-prevailing anti-britishburnham at least has the honesty to say that socialism isn’t coming; the others merely say that socialism is coming, and then give the word “socialism” a new meaning which makes nonsense of the old one.if i had to make a prophecy, i should say that a continuation of the russian policies of the last fifteen years — and internal and external policy, of course, are merely two facets of the same thing — can only lead to a war conducted with atomic bombs, which will make hitler’s invasion look like a tea-party. but at any rate, the russian régime will either democratise itself, or it will perish. the huge, invincible, everlasting slave empire of which burnham appears to dream will not be established, or, if established, will not endure, because slavery is no longer a stable basis for human society.the question only arises because in exploring the physical universe man has made no attempt to explore himself. much of what goes by the name of pleasure is simply an effort to destroy consciousness.this mixture of vagueness and sheer incompetence is the most marked characteristic of modern english prose, and especially of any kind of political writing. as soon as certain topics are raised, the concrete melts into the abstract and no one seems able to think of turns of speech that are not hackneyed: prose consists less and less of words chosen for the sake of their meaning, and more and more of phrases tacked together like the sections of a prefabricated hen-house.pretentious diction. words like phenomenon, element, individual (as noun), objective, categorical, effective, virtual, basis, primary, promote, constitute, exhibit, exploit, utilize, eliminate, liquidate, are used to dress up simple statements and give an air of scientific impartiality to biased judgments.meaningless words. in certain kinds of writing, particularly in art criticism and literary criticism, it is normal to come across long passages which are almost completely lacking in meaning. * words like romantic, plastic, values, human, dead, sentimental, natural, vitality, as used in art criticism, are strictly meaningless, in the sense that they not only do not point to any discoverable object, but are hardly even expected to do so by the reader. when one critic writes, “the outstanding feature of mr. x’s work is its living quality,” while another writes, “the immediately striking thing about mr. x’s work is its peculiar deadness,” the reader accepts this as a simple difference of opinionin the case of a word like democracy, not only is there no agreed definition, but the attempt to make one is resisted from all sides. it is almost universally felt that when we call a country democratic we are praising it: consequently the defenders of every kind of régime claim that it is a democracy, and fear that they might have to stop using the word if it were tied down to any one meaning. words of this kind are often used in a consciously dishonest way. that is, the person who uses them has his own private definition, but allows his hearer to think he means something quite different.as i have tried to show, modern writing at its worst does not consist in picking out words for the sake of their meaning and inventing images in order to make the meaning clearer. it consists in gumming together long strips of words which have already been set in order by someone else, and making the results presentable by sheer humbug.a scrupulous writer, in every sentence that he writes, will ask himself at least four questions, thus: what am i trying to say? what words will express it? what image or idiom will make it clearer? is this image fresh enough to have an effect? and he will probably ask himself two more: could i put it more shortly? have i said anything that is avoidably ugly? but you are not obliged to go to all this trouble. you can shirk it by simply throwing your mind open and letting the ready-made phrases come crowding in.when one watches some tired hack on the platform mechanically repeating the familiar phrases — bestial atrocities, iron heel, bloodstained tyranny, free peoples of the world, stand shoulder to shoulder— one often has a curious feeling that one is not watching a live human being but some kind of dummy:in our time, political speech and writing are largely the defense of the indefensible. things like the continuance of british rule in india, the russian purges and deportations, the dropping of the atom bombs on japan, can indeed be defended, but only by arguments which are too brutal for most people to face, and which do not square with the professed aims of political parties. thus political language has to consist largely of euphemism, question-begging and sheer cloudy vagueness. defenseless villages are bombarded from the air, the inhabitants driven out into the countryside, the cattle machine-gunned, the huts set on fire with incendiary bullets: this is called pacification.the inflated style is itself a kind of euphemism. a mass of latin words falls upon the facts like soft snow, blurring the outlines and covering up all the details. the great enemy of clear language is insincerity. when there is a gap between one’s real and one’s declared aims, one turns, as it were instinctively, to long words and exhausted idioms, like a cuttlefish squirting out ink. in our age there is no such thing as “keeping out of politics.” all issues are political issues, and politics itself is a mass of lies, evasions, folly, hatred and schizophrenia. when the general atmosphere is bad, language must suffer. i should expect to find — this is a guess which i have not sufficient knowledge to verify — that the german, russian and italian languages have all deteriorated in the last ten or fifteen years as a result of dictatorship.he has an extraordinarily clear prevision of the spy-haunted “police state”, with its endless heresy-hunts and treason trials, all really designed to neutralize popular discontent by changing it into war hysteria.if one is capable of intellectual detachment, one can perceive merit in a writer whom one deeply disagrees with, but enjoyment is a different matter. supposing that there is such a thing as good or bad art, then the goodness or badness must reside in the work of art itself — not independently of the observer, indeed, but independently of the mood of the observer. in one sense, therefore, it cannot be true that a poem is good on monday and bad on tuesday. but if one judges the poem by the appreciation it arouses, then it can certainly be true, because appreciation, or enjoyment, is a subjective condition which cannot be commanded.in communist literature the attack on intellectual liberty is usually masked by oratory about “petty-bourgeois individualism”, “the illusions of nineteenth-century liberalism”, etc., and backed up by words of abuse such as “romantic” and “sentimental”, which, since they do not have any agreed meaning, are difficult to answer. in this way the controversy is maneuvered away from its real issue.from the totalitarian point of view history is something to be created rather than learned. a totalitarian state is in effect a theocracy, and its ruling caste, in order to keep its position, has to be thought of as infallible. but since, in practice, no one is infallible, it is frequently necessary to rearrange past events in order to show that this or that mistake was not made, or that this or that imaginary triumph actually happened. then again, every major change in policy demands a corresponding change of doctrine and a revelation of prominent historical figures.there is no such thing as a genuinely non-political literature, and least of all in an age like our own, when fears, hatreds, and loyalties of a directly political kind are near to the surface of everyone’s consciousness. even a single taboo can have an all-round crippling effect upon the mind, because there is always the danger that any thought which is freely followed up may lead to the forbidden thought. it follows that the atmosphere of totalitarianism is deadly to any kind of prose writer, though a poet, at any rate a lyric poet, might possibly find it breathable. and in any totalitarian society that survives for more than a couple of generations, it is probable that prose literature, of the kind that has existed during the past four hundred years, must actually come to an end. literature has sometimessome, at least, of the english scientists who speak so enthusiastically of the opportunities to be enjoyed by scientists in russia are capable of understanding this. but their reflection appears to be: “writers are persecuted in russia. so what? i am not a writer.” they do not see that any attack on intellectual liberty, and on the concept of objective truth, threatens in the long run every department of thought.all writers are vain, selfish, and lazy, and at the very bottom of their motives there lies a mystery. writing a book is a horrible, exhausting struggle, like a long bout of some painful illness. one would never undertake such a thing if one were not driven on by some demon whom one can neither resist nor understand.one’s real reaction to a book, when one has a reaction at all, is usually “i like this book” or “i don’t like it”, and what follows is a rationalisation. but “i like this book” is not, i think, a non-literary reaction; the non-literary reaction is “this book is on my side, and therefore i must discover merits in it”.to accept an orthodoxy is always to inherit unresolved contradictions. take for instance the fact that all sensitive people are revolted by industrialism and its products, and yet are aware that the conquest of poverty and the emancipation of the working class demand not less industrialisation, but more and more. or take the fact that certain jobs are absolutely necessary and yet are never done except under some kind of coercion. or take the fact that it is impossible to have a positive foreign policy without having powerful armed forces. one could multiply examples. in every such case there is a conclusion which is perfectly plain but which can only be drawn if one is privately disloyal to the official ideology. the normal response is to push the question, unanswered, into a corner of one’s mind, and then continue repeating contradictory catchwords. one does not have to search far through the reviews and magazines to discover the effects of this kind of thinking.to yield subjectively, not merely to a party machine, but even to a group ideology, is to destroy yourself as a writer. we feel this dilemma to be a painful one, because we see the need of engaging in politics while also seeing what a dirty, degrading business it is. and most of us still have a lingering belief that every choice, even every political choice, is between good and evil, and that if a thing is necessary it is also right. we should, i think, get rid of this belief, which belongs to the nursery. in politics one can never do more than decide which of two evils is the lesser, and there are some situations from which one can only escape by acting like a devil or a lunatic.it is difficult to see how gandhi’s methods could be applied in a country where opponents of the régime disappear in the middle of the night and are never heard of again. without a free press and the right of assembly, it is impossible not merely to appeal to outside opinion, but to bring a mass movement into being, or even to make your intentions known to your adversary. is there a gandhi in russia at this moment? and if there is, what is he accomplishing?as a non-fiction book, this is very well written - it's on the level of an undergrad, with few actual formulas and very little "jargon" (most of it is hidden in the footnotes for interested readers). since the author often intersperses her own personal views and experiences working in the field the book feels more like listening to an excited relative explain his or her field at a party than a technical explanation at a conference. i'm also impressed about the overall niceness of this book - for example, i would've found stronger words about wolfram's research on cellular automata, which others have. as a rule many of the portrayed more modern scientists seem to have an ego so big that it stands in the way of truth - i.e., their new pet theory is supposed to explain most of biology but is just an oversimplified exercise that quickly falls flat once actual data is incorporated. but again, mitchell doesn't make fun of these models but sees them as necessary stepping stones towards a better model.to summarize, like basti said in his review, you got to love a book that brings together so many giants of different scientific disciplines.if you are not german, then there's a good chance you've never heard of marcel reich-ranicki (pronounced reich like that thing the nazis tried to build, ranicki like "ranitzky"). in germany, up until his death last year he was the guy for "german high culture" - if there was a controversial new german book, at least one tv-station would interview him. the biggest newspapers put him on the cover when he wrote a more important critique (most famously, this cover: ). with a few others he had a huge weekly tv show in which they argued about new and old books. like all germans, i grew up with the guy, at my parents' place there's two of the book collections he put out, each collection a case of about 20 big books with the (to reich-ranicki) most important german literature. in 1999 he published his autobiography, and it's great!from now on spoilers.roughly split into two parts, the first one being marcel reich-ranicki's youth in poland and berlin, then his internment in the jewish ghetto in warschau, how he lost his entire family to treblinka, married his wife in the ghetto (the story of how he met her - wow) how he escaped with tons of luck, was hidden by a polish worker, until the soviet army invaded poland in 1944 and he was free.the second part of the book is his short work for the polish government as a kind of till eulenspiegel spy who doesn't know anything about his work and receives no orders, then his disenchantment with communist poland, his move to germany and his rise to become the biggest critic of german literature, publishing articles weekly, being in constant contact with all famous writers of germany after 1945. he never even went to university, apart from high school, he was completely self-taught. amazing.the first part should interest everyone, the detached way he writes about the loss of so many people close to him kills you. the second part is probably only of interest to germans, or those who are into modern german literature. people like günter grass, anna seghers (great story about reich-ranicki realizing that she didn't understand her own work), wolfgang koeppen, golo mann, stefan fest and more make up the bulk of this part (how cool was wolfgang koeppen?), and if these names don't tell you anything, then the second part will bore you.there is however a great, short anecdote in that part in which joachim fest invited albert speer ("hitler's architect" and close associate, free after 15 years of prison) and reich-ranicki to the same book release and it's a small miracle reich-ranicki didn't murder speer on the spot. i might have.throughout both parts the love for literature and music abounds, full of quotes, so this book is a treat for fans of literature. i read through the 500+ pages in one or two days. last month a new collection of older essays on german literature was published in germany, can't wait to read it.not recommended for: if you're not into books, you'll probably be bored. but what are you doing on goodreads then?for me personally, too much like "the brief wondrous life of oscar wao" (very similar setting: most of the stories are about dominican immigrants in the us struggling with life, similar characters: at least two comic book nerds appear. similar stories - sex and confusion.) if you read the aforementioned i guess you can skip this.kind of a hit-and-miss thing - "the nose" and "the overcoat" are seriously great, the others, not so much.a very short book in the form of a series of questions - why do you behave this or that way, why don't you do this or that, with a short answer from the author (who, to be fair, was about 13 years old). however, every time the answer gets interesting and acquires some depth it just cuts off, "next question!".in other cases the explanations are too much platitude for my taste:i think that people with autism are born outside the regime of civilization. sure, this is just my own made-up theory, but i think that, as a result of all the killings in the world and selfish planet-wrecking that humanity has committed, a deep sense of crisis exists. autism has somehow arisen out of this. this must be my favorite book about the internet, the only one that properly captures the "culture" that has arisen since about 2000. of course, since it's a pynchon book, everything is a bit confusing and there are layers upon layers - in this case, there's a onion-based deepweb with virtual avatars (not sure if that's ironic or not) as a layer below the internet. there's a woman trying to understand a conspiracy that may not exist in the first place. there are jokes about the long development time of daikatana, nitpicky dialogues about random vs. pseudo-random numbers, ghost in the shell quotes, murders, a strip-club called "joie de beavre", a professional nose (i.e., a private investigator who works only with smells), and of course, nothing is ever really resolved, and paranoia is the basic form of consciousness. impressive that pynchon, who certainly doesn't count as a "digital native" - at the time of bleeding edge's writing, he was about 75 years old - is the first one who can actually write a good novel about the internet. neuromancer hasn't aged well, ready player one is more concerned with cramming 80s references, some pretend to be about the internet but are actually about the thing you watched when angelina jolie logged into a server in the movie hackers (like mankell's firewall). when pynchon mentions back orifice and netbus i get nostalgic for my script kiddie days.of course not all references make sense, for example, the daikatana joke - the game actually was released about a year before the novel takes place. but then again, who wants to know?recommended for: fans of fun, the internet, post-modern books making fun of post-modern books. fans of the crying of lot 49, i feel like both books are a bit more "pynchon light", i.e., they are easier to follow. not recommended for: people who need a clean, straight-cut story with all of their story-lines resolved.what begins as a scathing critic of modern civilization, showing that humanity is just a bunch of animals with a thin layer of civilization on top that comes flying off the minute there's trouble, ends as a book full of love for humans.funny enough, this book often touches the things discussed in joseph campbell's the power of myth - while campbell focuses on "classic" myths, this book shows that most of the things we take for granted nowadays are just myths themselves.that night i slept there, but the next morning i began to hate the place. with her there it was part of a dream; without her, it was a house.an interesting take on the past and possible future of cyber attacks, meant as a rebuttal to the currently superficial discussion on cyber security by state officials and media. it starts with the title's thesis (you can't have "cyber war" when you see "war" according to von clausewitz' definitions), but goes further than that by splitting up "cyber attacks" into sub-groups like "subversion", "espionage" etc., and shows how these have changed due to the nature of the internet and how the future may look like. there's lots of interesting thoughts here i'll have to digest (e.g., there's a possibility that cyber attacks are "anti-violence", in that you can now reach your goals without having to physically harm people; there probably won't be a "cyber 9/11" since to be efficient in your attacks, you need to a ton of money, knowledge, and people , etc.)as a bonus it contains one of the best write-ups of stuxnet i've read.recommended for: those interested in the intersection of the internet and politicsi'm a big fan of wallace's essay, not so much of his prose. to me, he often writes "too technical" since he knows so much about literature and writing that he easily can switch, and try to advance, different writing styles. however, in this "advancing" the stories often loose their blood; reading them turns into a non-trivial technical exercise instead of fun.having said that, the titular interviews are still really good, mostly because these are pure dialogue without any über-stilted elements. it's a little bit like reading through /r/redpill, except that this one is fiction (and thus allows the horror to be replaced by "mere" amusement ). even the strange logic is there, full of the usual biologisms and false equivalences...recommended for: people who're not constantly on the internet and should learn that hellalotta people are creeps with weird reasoningyou probably know the story, so i won't bother with that. sagan is certainly no poet, the language in this book is concise and to the point - no flowery similes, no poetic parts, it's pure story (and large parts of the story don't even have protagonists, it's just descriptions of what's going on internationally).sagan's experience on government bodies is clearly showing in this book, it's surprisingly heavy on international, science and office politics. a bit funny that in this book, the soviet union still exists in 1999. the biggest spot of bother is the ending. it's a weird, vague thing - of course, a human author who tries to describe a species that far surpasses humans in every aspect can only fail. sagan found a nice way to sneak out of that dilemma, but then he destroys it by having the main character find a message in pi, just like that? i mean, people have been automatically computing pi for decades now, it feels illogical that the main character can do that on her own.a mixed bag. it's definitely a great story, and the characters involved are certainly "originals" who warrant that this story be told - sometimes the narration jumps too much through time-points, sometimes it's just not that interesting, sometimes the craziness of the entire operation somehow becomes dull.the best chapter is the last autobiographical chapter in which the author details his search for the leftovers of the involved warships; would've liked to see more of that.stanislaw lem is still my favorite sf-author - this one is a very common lem book, alien worlds so alien that most things that happen are and stay unexplainable; where this one comes off the usual path is that in the end, there's actually a bit of explanation! of course, like usually with lem, it stays short and many things remain unexplained (but that's the good part).my main grudge with lem is that his descriptions just don't activate my "head's inner cinema", maybe that's the translation but i remember that i had the same problem with german translations... in a nutshell, his descriptions are very technical and don't flow very well:... a smooth slab that crumbled at the edges and was flanked on either side by slanting surfaces that bore a series of notches.(p. 107)read this edition: http://ebooks.adelaide.edu.au/h/hornung/ew/amateur-cracksman/basically, sherlock holmes from the point of the thief. the narrator is a watson-like character (even though much more inept - watson, after all, was a decorated war-hero, a better shot than holmes and a medical doctor able to patch up the wounded), each story is one crime etc. of course, since this is a british book, raffles only steals from "bad guys" or when it's really necessary, and wouldn't hurt a fly.and how british some sentences:with a pitch to help me, i'd have done something big; as it is, three for forty-one, out of the four that fell, isn't so bad for a slow bowler on a plumb wicket against those fellows.watkindle singles are a funny thing - basically cheap short stories or novellas made possible by having no cost for printing & distribution. you can read dead pig collector in an hour, and you might quickly forget it; just like with gun machine it's a story that would fit better into a comic than into a novel for lack of "believability". relatively enjoyable - his viewpoint is not to trust in the least, according to him, he was more or less the best artist who ever lived, and all his enemies were idiots or worse. the book is great fun when he describes how he plotted to murder his enemies, how he got into fights about basically nothing, and how he single-handedly escaped from prison.sometimes drags _a lot_ when he describes politics. a borges bootleg! transcripts of recordings of a few lectures on english literature borges gave in the 1960s in buenos aires, before he was internationally famous, which is why the recordings of these lectures don't exist anymore.interestingly, it's very conversational in tone, there's very little university related talking going on (of course, there is a possibility that the editors cut this) - borges talks only once about tests, never again about anything but anglo-saxon/english literature; he seems to be more concerned about recommending books students should read instead of drilling tidbits of knowledge into them for tests. that's another amazing thing about these lectures; borges was already mostly blind, everything he quotes (for some reason in spanish) is from memory, all years and all facts are from his head, which is why he so often gets students to read longer poems to the class for him.but, if you're looking for borges as a builder of mysterious worlds, you won't find him here; these are introductory lectures, there's very little interpretation, more often than not borges is more concerned with how fun the story is and how beautiful the language sounds than he bothers with explaining, as an example, the political background of why a certain writer wrote this poem. sometimes it's strange in that he gets a student to read a poem in english, then summarizes the story in the middle of the poem (remember, the students are young and probably didn't know much english yet), then lets the student read the rest of the poem, and at that point you would have expected borges to talk some more about what they just read, focus on single elements and interpret them, but he just has the student read the next poem. another curious thing is the choice of authors by borges - there's only a single page on shakespeare, but an entire lecture on stevenson.recommended for: people who are looking for an introduction to english literature, or those who need more books on their to-read shelfnot recommended for: people who want to see a blind man construct a library containing every possible booka long essay (based on a series of lectures) on how the current dawkins/hitchens atheism-movement has it all wrong, they don't know enough about christianity to be good critics of it, and most of their criticisms have been invalidated by thomas aquinas (fun!). of course, he can't pass the chance to criticize modern christianity himself:christianity long ago shifted from the side of the poor and dispossessed to that of the rich and aggressive. the liberal establishment really has little to fear from it and everything to gain. for the most part, it has become the creed of the suburban well-to-do, not the astonishing promise offered to the riffraff and undercover anticolonial militants with whom jesus himself hung out. eagleton is a well-read writer full of wit, and it be great to listen to eagleton speak.it gets a bit weird once eagleton goes all "religion is not the modern problem, capitalism is!!! now let's all talk about how great socialism is!", but i think that is to be expected with his writing. it's similar in "on evil" towards the end.fun quote:the new testament is a brutal destroyer of human illusions. if you follow jesus and don't end up dead, it appears you have some explaining to do.if you're unsure whether 2666 is something for you, read this first - a collection of _beautiful_ short-stories which share many of the motifs and themes with 2666 (melancholy, disappeared authors who never really existed, wanderlust...)i really, really tried to give this a chance, seeing as most "best of science fiction" lists regularly list this book somewhere in (or close to) the top 10. however, this book is impossible to finish.the story: a human, after he grew up with the elves, is returned to humankind. mankind's society is alien to him but lucky for him the elves taught him magic, for example, he can make people and things vanish with the power of this thoughts.no wait, that was wrong.the story: a human, after he grew up with the martians, is returned to humankind. mankind's society is alien to him but lucky for him the martians taught him special powers, for example, he can make people and things vanish with the power of this thoughts.yes, that's more like it. as you can see, i don't think this book is much science fiction: yes, it has spaceships, but no, it doesn't have the great ideas of science-fiction. all this offers is fantasy's escapism, and heinlein's crude ideas, his own imitation of science-fiction's ideas.oh, the ideas: it seems that every time heinlein had an idea he had to write an sf-book about the idea, explaining why it's the greatest idea ever and every body should follow it.starship troopers? "military dictatorship is the best thing, here's half a book of lectures on the topic with some fight scenes in between."the moon is a harsh mistress? "libertarianism is best, here's half a book of lectures with some fight scenes in between."and this one, stranger in a strange land? "polygamy is best, here's a science-fiction book with the latter half being lectures." to be precise, this book is more about polygyny, and of course only heterosexual!the women in this book seem to fail the bechdel test: one of the main protagonists of this book is female and i swear 99% of her thoughts are either about the man from mars or about her fiancee. she doesn't seem to have her own motivations, which goes for the other female characters, as well.and then the writing and plotting - heinlein seems to be the king of the overpowered deus ex machina, having the man from mars always learn new magic tricks when the situation calls for it. the protagonists always have the upper hand, they're never truly in danger. are they being attacked? shazam, the man form mars can "wish" people away. is the man from mars stuck somewhere? abracadabra, he can leave his body and, i don't know, "walk on the astral plane"? that's how doctor strange does it. the moon is a harsh mistress does this as well, by the way - the protagonists have that massively overpowered, invincible ai on their side. in gaming terms: heinlein is the king of buffing.so yeah, i can't understand how and why people love heinlein so much - i guess its an overhang from their childhoods (which also explains why everybody loves the infantile enders game so much).tl;dr avoid!easily the best sf i've read in the last few years - the constant techno-babble is, especially in the beginning, sometimes overwhelming since rajaniemi seems to be a huge fan of "show, don't tell". only in the middle or so did i start to understand basic concepts like gevulet etc., so that might warrant a re-read.there are numerous references to the "classic" thief arsène lupin, i have a hunch this book started out as a re-telling of some of lupin's stories in an sf-setting but then became more. recommended for:- sf-fans, classic thief-novel fansnot for:- people who already get pissed off by star trek's technobabble3.5 - the best thing was the tone, the melancholy seeping through everythingextremely interesting! describes the life up until the nobel prize of the wheat scientist/breeder dr. norman borlaug. if you need information on him, here's an excerpt from penn & teller, including a short interview with borlaug: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cebto25xw-o (nsfw language). in a nutshell, he developed wheat-varieties with extremely high yield, raised mexico from a poor wheat-importing country to a wheat-exporting country, and prevented famines in india, pakistan and china. makes for some interesting thoughts on the current gmo-debate (did you know hybrid seeds in the 1930s were not allowed to be re-sold?), mostly because people are now acting the same way they did towards borlaug's hybrid seeds in the 60s ("it's unnatural", "we're too dependent on modern methods", "traditional plants go into extinction" etc.). especially in the beginning is the writing a bit weird (quote: "contemplating those events upstairs was super scary"), thus the 4 stars.it's also interesting that borlaug was able to give seeds of new hybrids away basically for free since he was funded mostly by the rockefeller foundation. good to know that the foundation is involved in the development of golden rice (which is available for free too for developing countries). plus it's only $3 on kindle, so there's that.recommended for: anyone who needs some inspiration on what one person can achieve in their life.2.5? 3? not sure what to think of this book - the (supposedly autobiographical) story of a pimp from the 1930s to the 1960s, complete with prostitutes, fun slang, heroin addiction etc.intended to show to prospective pimps how everybody involved in that business in the end just dies way too young and broken, but i guess similar to the movie scarface it has the opposite effect.suffers from the same things 'rendezvous with rama' suffers from - the author had a cool, well thought-out idea of a "neat thing" in space, only to realize that you can't fill a book with just describing the "thing", so a story has to be constructed around it.as such, the story either drags on or is a thinly veiled vehicle for descriptions of the ringworld. only in the last ~10% of the book does the story pick up and things actually happen, before that it's just "and then the party had to go over there because that's where i, larry, imagined that other cool thing i wanted to describe".i've read that this book is "hard sci-fi", as in, "the things happening in this book are based on valid science". this is only true for parts of the book, mainly the descriptions and basics of the ringworld. the biology, on the other hand, is absolutely bonkers. not only does riven describe natural selection as "survival of the strongest" , you also (spoiler!) have a race breeding humans for luck, and the description of why this works boils down to "fate" (as in: "her luck wanted her to be stranded here"). and just like star trek the aliens are not very imaginative either - here again the entire species has just one culture, just one language, just one "look". if we ever meet aliens that will be far from the truth (consider us humans - you drive for 1 hour in europe and you already meet a different culture, language etc.).2 stars, but only because of the ringworld.recommended for: fans of science-fiction. (slightly aged sci-fi ok?)not recommended for: the rest of the world. and in extent, a lot of science-fiction out there a common misconception that came en vogue in the 1920s, 1930s with the rise of eugenics, when us and german eugenics proponents used this misconception to validate their quest to "eliminate the weak". in reality, natural selection is about "survival of the fittest" in which "fitness" does not mean strength, but reproductive success. consider two brothers: one is relatively weak but sexually mature at age 10, the other one is stronger but needs more time to sexually mature since his body had to invest resources into strength, let's say he matures by 15. both die at 20. who can have more children?  shook hands like two old friends who valued each other at their true worth; then the detective stepped to the door.  "ganimard!"  "what is it?" asked ganimard, as he turned back.  "you have forgotten your watch."  "my watch?"  "yes, it strayed into my pocket."  he returned the watch, excusing himself.  "pardon me... a bad habit."tl;dr: trolling is a artthe problem with ebooks is that you can't throw them against the wall. in this case of mullis' autobiography, or rather loose collection of essays, i wanted to do exactly that about 5 times - it has been a long time since i've been this physically angry at a book.the first quarter of the book is alright - he details how he perfected pcr, how he got the nobel prize for that, etc. the one thing  that starts to annoy is his constant drive to portray himself as such an unconventional person - "hey everybody, i go to strip-clubs! i'm ok with drugs! i was totally spontaneous and cool when i met the wife of the japanese tenno!" you just expect at some point to read "hi every1 im new!!!!!!! holds up spork my name is kary but u can call me t3h pengu1n of d00m!!!!!!!! lol…as u can see im very random!!!!" etc. pp.some of the early chapters are interesting, for example, when he tries to explain the scientific method. why he then goes and throws everything out of the window is beyond me - i think it's because he loves being in a position opposite to the mainstream, even if that means distorting and twisting the truth until it becomes a lie.first, the chapter about his belief in astrology - his evidence that it exists: 3 people guessed his star-sign. also, a program used the constellation of planets at his birth to describe his character, and i quote: "most of the things that the fifty-page document said about me were correct. but some of them were entirely wrong." (p. 118). guess what, that's how horoscopes are written! make them so vague and general that "most of the things" are correct! it doesn't take a scientist to notice that, yet mullis constantly assures us that he's a scientist. literally: "i am a scientist", at least 3 or 4 times in the book.then it gets worse and he "goes full retard" (tropic thunder, 2008), in his views on global warming: "what is the trouble with something being out of balance if the natural state of that thing is change?" (p94).  he then goes on:  "the concept that human beings are capable of causing the planet to overheat or lose its ozone seems about as ridiculous as blaming the magdalenian paintings for the last ice age" (p 96). that's his entire rhetoric - he doesn't cite any proof to the contrary, he just does his impression of rush limbaugh. that's it!we humans can and have changed this planet massively, starting with "small things" like the artificial suez canal, to changing the entire picture of earth at night. we got enough weapons to irradiate and destroy the surface of the earth. and of course the state of earth is change, the problem we humans might get is that this change might wipe us out. he conveniently doesn't mention this - it doesn't fit his story.the chapter that made me truly angry is the one where he starts to deny the hiv->aids causality, and that's when he gets so self-satisfied and the smugness just oozes out of the pages, into your lap, forcing you to take a shower. he says that the presence of hiv-antibodies shows that hiv has been defeated: "antibodies signaled that the virus had been defeated. the patient had saved himself." (p 139). that's like saying that the presence of soldiers shows that there is no war. this shows that he either doesn't know a thing about the human immune system or he outright lies to save his worldview, i don't know if wikipedia was very big in 1998, but a look into an encyclopedia could have certainly helped him. and then he goes in and does these absolutely dirty tricks: "they didn't show that everybody with the antibodies had the disease. in fact, they found some healthy people with antibodies." (p 139). that is so dishonest that i'm getting angry again just typing this - it takes time for the symptoms of a disease to develop . he goes into his descriptions of some of the major players of the early hiv "controversy", notably gallo and duesberg. he uses language again to make one look good and one look bad: "in spite of his lack of luster as a scientist, gallo had worked his way up in the power structure. peter duesberg, despite his brilliance, worked his way down" (p 142). peter duesberg is one of the biggest douchebags in recent history, and one of the first hiv-denialists. he used to be the editor at pnas and used that status to circumvent peer-review for one of his denialist articles, something which muller describes this way: "duesberg pointed out wisely from the sidelines in the proceedings of the national academy of science that there was no good evidence implicating the new virus." (p 143). he again conveniently doesn't mention that duesberg used his (former) status to get his article into pnas. he also ignores the hiv-aids evidence that was already available in 1998, most disingenuous by saying that "no-one had proven that hiv causes aids". the problem with proving that is that you have to literally infect a human with hiv, something which no ethics committee in the world will approve. but there are some cases from before the publication of this book which mullis could have had a look at.there's the florida dentist case from 1990, in which a dentist unknowingly infected some of his patients, who were all tested positive for hiv and later died of aids, same as the dentist, wikipedia has an overview: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/kimberly_bergalis this case was the first case in which someone proved that hiv causes aids, something which mullis conveniently forgets. that was 8 years before this book! another big case was when three lab workers got infected with hiv and developed aids, that was in 1997, maybe too close to the publication of this book (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9045880). there's a mountain of evidence for the causality hiv->aids, but mullis always pretends as if he's the lone warrior showing the world that "the big pharma-companies" just want to make money with the disease of others. see here for evidence: http://www.niaid.nih.gov/topics/hivaids/understanding/howhivcausesaids/pages/hivcausesaids.aspx by the way: after the publication of this book, duesberg became a member of the advisory panel to thabo mbeki in south africa, and his denialism prevented the use of antiretroviral drugs, one of the main reasons why aids spread so much leading to literally hundreds of thousands who died of aids in south africa. that man has a lot of blood on his hand! (check wikipedia: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/peter_duesberg)and then, the prime piece, the one that made me throw my kindle across the room, the most disgusting sentence i've read all year: "if a person has three hundred sexual contact a year - with people who themselves are having three hundred contacts a year - that's ninety thousand times more opportunity for infections than a person involved in an exclusive relationship". (p 146) yes it's their own fault that they have aids. these disgusting pigs and their filthy polygamy!!  let's all shame more victims. edit: according to the who, 2% of the 8 million children who die per year die because of aids. did these have too much sex too? (source: http://www.who.int/pmnch/media/press_materials/fs/fs_mdg4_childmortality/en/index.html)does he cite peer-reviewed publications for any of his viewpoints? in one chapter he makes fun of a nutritionist for not citing any sources in her "crusade" against margarine, and writes that you should always cite sources. yet there isn't a single paper cited in this book, a thing you would think a scientist would do.of course, there are the other crazy things  i don't want to go into because to him, they happened, and i can't criticize that. there's a lot more going on in this book that for the purpose of my sanity i will now forget so i can't write about it here.the only thing you'll learn in this book is that you shouldn't trust people just because they got a prize, even if it's the nobel prize.  apparently the official title is "chief wife"? http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/emperor_of_japan especially in hiv that can take up to 3 months, in some cases several years: http://aids.gov/hiv-aids-basics/hiv-aids-101/signs-and-symptoms/ capslock is cruise control for rage glowing raccoons abducting him over night. someone saving him from a laughing gas overdose via astral travelling. his telepathy with a friend. that said friend's face morphing into other faces, even though mullis was sober. etc."classic" sf - not particularly interesting or well-written, i guess easily forgettable (time will tell), mostly because this story has been soaked up so much by popular culture that one has encountered it a billion times before.fun, short book (or long essay?) on "evil" in theology and literature and a little bit on "evil" in history. you don't have to agree with eagleton's conclusions to enjoy this (in fact, i disagree with most of them - i think "evil" doesn't even exist). eagleton is a literary theorist and a marxist and it clearly shows. for him, evil is caused by institutions that make normally "ok" people do evil things. he doesn't really support this with studies or any numbers, he rather shows characters from literature as examples for his conclusions, or points to the nazis. whether you like that or not is up to you, i think "hard" scientists will be annoyed. his writing, however, is beautiful and so british:perhaps children murder each other all the time and are simply keeping quiet about it . perhaps this is because we are ready to believe all kinds of sinister things about children, since they seem like a halfalien race in our midst. since they do not work, it is not clear what they are for. (p. 4)or wisely on p. 117, the last page:but there is a difference between regretting this tragically lost opportunity, and treating one's enemies as mindless beasts whom no rational action could ever conceivably sway. for champions of this viewpoint, the only solution to terrorist violence is more violence. more violence then breeds more terror, which in turn puts more blameless lives at risk. the result of defining terrorism as evil is to exacerbate the problem; and to make the problem worse is to be complicit, however unwittingly, in the very barbarism you condemn. i personally would have at least included the case-study of the murdering necrophiliac homosexual duck to show that "evil" in the form of senseless violence exists in nature too: c.w. moeliker (2001). "the first case of homosexual necrophilia in the anas platyrhynchos (aves:anatidae)". deinsea - annual of the natural history museum rotterdam 8: 243–247. not sure what to make of this - it's a novella-length rant with the alternative title of "neoliberalism/privatization sucks, and why we should go back to proper social democracy". the focus is on the us and the uk with a little bit of the rest of western europe thrown in. one of the best parts in the book is when judt traces the history of the idea of "me first, others second" from the 18th/19th century until today and shows how this whole mess has spread. my personal problem is that there's nothing new in here for me, all of these points have been discussed in the german left for the last 30 years. except that his rant doesn't include the "evils" of gentrification. not as fun as "voyage of the space beagle" - "slans" are proto-x-men, stronger and faster than normal humans who can additionally read minds. of course, there has been a war between the humans and the slans nearly killing all slans and forcing them to go underground. enter our hero jommy cross (because jimmy would have been too normal! also "cross" because jesus!), an orphan of gentle, genius slan parents who where forced to live undercover, but both were killed by the mean humans. of course, jommy is as righteous, bold, daring, all around class act without a single fault, and it's in his hands to re-unite the humans and the slans etc. pp., you know the deal. when he's in a rut, one of his genius gadgets or dumb luck are there to safe him. it's not fun! got a nice cheap australian edition from the 70s for $1, yessssss lifeline bookfest.recommended for: people who like cheesy golden age sci-fi.not recommended for: the other 99.9% of humankind.this took forever to read, not because the contents were boring, but because most of it went way over my head. sometimes, entire pages seem to have been machine-translated from german, to which feyerabend added greek and latin quotes, and cites ten different philosophers and forgotten authors to make the confusion complete. i had to look up quite a few english words (incommensurable, counter-inductive, etc.). but then suddenly, the next 5 pages are crystal clear and genius! to summarize his points: scientific conduct and progress is much more chaotic and "law-less" than proponents and practitioners of science realize. he makes his point by showing how galileo didn't win europe over to copernicanism by showing a theory that explained reality "better" (as one would assume), galileo won everyone over by inventing a few tools, hiding a few inconvenient datapoints, being a good propagandist, and a lot of trickery.for me as a scientist reading against method is freeing. there is a break in between how we do science and how we present it to the public - for example, the structure of a scientific publiction has absolutely nothing to do with how the actual results were obtained. in my case with bioinformatics, i start to play around with data, and walk down 500 paths of which 499 don't work. i get some interesting results, and try to make sense of them by looking through the literature, and i finally find some biological phenomenon that might fit. using that phenomenon as a start, i think how i can prove or disprove it - find one way to prove it - and write the paper. this has nothing to do with the scientific method of hypothesis -> prediction -> testing with data, yet the publication i write follows this structure (i also do not list the 499 things i tried, thereby "inventing" a story that is cleaner than reality). phdcomics had this fitting comic a few years ago.feyerabend correctly sees that stringent application of the "rules" of science would make science impossible. for example, if falsification were to be applied stringently we simply couldn't have bioinformatics. play around with one of the settings in your genome assembler, and you get a slightly different genome - which one is the correct one? if i computationally predict genes in a genome, i get around 400,000 genes. which ones do really exist? there are surely ways to falsify this, but the technology does not exist (or it's a tedious, expensive and literally life-consuming work). as long as the technology does not exist, we proceed and publish: "anything goes". this makes science much more a field of play than people realize. schools do not teach this: according to what i learned in high school about science, i should be much more stuffy and strict. yet a large part of my work is playing around in an r console, looking for fun things, making pretty pictures, and drinking free coffee.where i don't agree with feyerabend in the slightest is his demand to split science from politics - i can understand where he's coming from, i guess up until the 80s the results of science where set in stone. what the scientist said was "true", to the detriment of science itself; feyerabend says that there are other systems alternative to science that are as good as, or even "better" than "western science" - he makes the case for traditional chinese science & medicine, which by now is known to be mostly placebo effect. i can't agree with him at all. the split of science and politics has (partially?) caused the mess we're in now.maybe by now, statistics has done the job feyerabend wanted other systems to do. the introduction of rigid tests, the spreading awareness of problems like the multiple comparisons problem, too small sample sizes and more, the availability of online anonymous comments etc., has helped to "dethrone" scientific results. i also can understand why scientists rarely read philosopy of science. large parts of this book serve as counter-arguments to popper and lakatos, i rarely understood anything there, since i've read very little philosophy of science.. plus i, like most scientists, don't understand latin or greek.recommended for: practitioners and "fans" of science, it's eye-opening.i think a much needed book, summarizing the current state of research on how fast evolution can occur in how tiny circumstances (and in turn showing you how complicated interactions in ecosystems can get!). it's definitely not written for laypeople, this is pure scientific writing. one minor caveat is that it doesn't talk much about humans, only in the form of how humans change ecosystems and thus cause rapid evolution. would've been interesting to compare this to the currently ongoing "we humans never change"-train of thought on which lots of evolutionary psychology/paleo-diet/etc. is based.this book was published a year before i was born. since then, i've jumped through most of the hoops society has laid out for budding scientists, and at some point in the next 2 years i should be allowed to call myself a "doctor of philosophy" or something like that ("burger flipper"?). it has come obvious to me that there's a ton of problems in scientific research, in the scientific community, and in the way research is conducted. it's also very funny to see that a lot of these problems have already been described in this book from 27 years ago. basically, it's a collection of essays in the style of marxist dialectics, i.e., a way of thinking that tries to incorporate entire systems instead of first trying to split a system into its parts and then analyzing these (the cartesian approach). i'm pretty sure dialectics has been re-invented as systems thinking in recent years by writers like donna meadows, even the way the graphs work is mostly identical.some interesting points, in no particular order:- evolutionary research tries to see the organism as the outcome of evolution, while levis/lewontin try to show that organisms also shape their own evolution (for starters, all species shape their environments, starting from their droppings to more complicated things like building nests/burrrows/dams/houses, and much much more).- gene/phenotype studies usually model the interaction between both as a one-way, one-to-one interaction, at one point in time, while there's a world outside this small scale which easily falsifies any results. much of this is currently repeated in criticisms of genome-wide association studies (gwas).- evolution as a theory is a product of the society it was invented in. it couldn't have been proposed in a stale, "god-given" medieval society.- i didn't realize before how much of darwin's thinking was shaped by malthus.- the essay on lysenkoism has some weird points, like that table showing that during the rise and acceptance of lysenkoism in the soviet union, yield grew and was a bit higher than in the us, and that's taken as a minor defense of lysenkoism. however, just because yield grew doesn't mean that lysenkoism was good - there could have been millions of reasons why that happened.- not sure why the essay on health in the latin american community is there; it's way too specialized to be of any interest- i'm pretty sure that each essay is a hidden angry rant about a recent publication, but since these essays are all fairly old (end 70s to mid 80s) i don't know the publication in question.- if you're a biologist, skip the first two essays, these are basically modified long dictionary entries showing the current state of evolution and biology. there's a lot in there you've heard before.- "the commodization of science" is awesome, a critique of (western) science as a tool of capitalist expansion, def. recommended (you don't have to agree)of course, one can criticize dialectic approaches as a bit far-strung - it's complicated enough to just look at a one-to-one interaction at one point in time, and success in this can already take a long time (easily more than a normal phd takes). analyzing the entire system at once makes things only "worse", so to speak. the statistical tools we now (2013) have developed for these "simple" interactions are already so complicated that i shudder to think what "proper" modelling of a complex system needs.on the writing: levins/lewontin seem to be big fans of the needlessly endless sentence. definitely no "pop science" material!anyway, if you're a biologist and you want a very different view on your science, go for it. similar goes for the interested layman. if, however, you're looking for a fun book you can read on your commute, stay away, for that it's too dry. a nice collection of essays on bad data, focusing mostly on bad data in companies and start-ups. i think only one essay handles scientific data. as all chapters are from different authors, there's sometimes a bit of overlap in between, and the "fun" reading them varies wildly.recommended for: people working with data for their jobgreat short stories - each one a completely different "voice" than the other, some got few elements of sf, most of them about families in various states of disfunction, some very funny, some sad but in a good way (especially the last one with the collection's title), but all life-affirming. this is one of the autobiographic non-fiction books in which the author tries something crazy and writes a book about the experience - similar to 'reading the oed' or 'the year of living biblically'. in this case, foer decides to become a memory champion in order to compete at the us championship. along the way he learns the memory tricks that are mostly based on the greeks' work but are still widely in use today, and uses the opportunity to write about the history of memory, some extremely interesting edge cases (like the guy who inspired rainman), some of the science behind remembering, how these techniques are having a small renaissance in teaching, and why it is that we can remember some things better than others (for example, spatial memories are easier and faster to remember than numbers). you'll learn that memory champions are not hyper-intelligent savants, but are just people who are well-trained in a specific set of tricks, similar to good magicians (a comparison foer repeats at least 3 times).of course, reading this book won't turn you into a all-remembering memory beast, for these tricks require too much initial work - for example, to remember a deck of cards you first have to remember a vibrant (if possible raunchy) image to connect the card to, so you don't have to remember the card itself, only the image. coming up with these images in the first place, and subsequently learning them for an entire deck of cards, already takes several days to weeks. and then you're in possession of one of the more useless tricks in the world, congratulations.and of course, there's one small story at the end to prove that when you're the memory champion you don't have to have a good memory: when foer returns from the us championship, he drives his car to a restaurant to have dinner with friends. later he returns home by tram, only to realize at home that he forgot he had a car.recommended for: people who always wondered what it would be like to know more than 3 digits of pi. people who constantly wonder where their car-keys are.wow, what a book. the background: lewis met joy davidman in life after she came to the uk to separate from her alcoholic/abusive husband. they became friends ("for jack the attraction was at first undoubtedly intellectual. joy was the only woman whom he had met ... who had a brain which matched his own in suppleness, in width of interest, and in analytical grasp, and above all in humour and a sense of fun."), and, after she was diagnosed with terminal cancer, they married in 1956. after a brief relapse she died in 1960. this very short book is lewis' way of trying to come to terms with his grief - it's painfully and brutally honest with himself and his confusion about his beliefs. he tries to understand his grief, he tries to understand to position the grief with his beliefs, and eventually he slightly comes to terms with it.the conclusion i dread is not 'so there's no god after all,' but 'so this is what god's really like. deceive yourself no longer.'or this one:but go to him when your need is desperate, when all other help is vain, and what do you find? a door slammed into your face, and a sound of bolting and double bolting on the inside.when he remembers her and tries to explain the amount of grief he's suffering and tries to come to terms with his grief, that's when someone's cutting onions around you:her absence is no more emphatic in those places than anywhere else. it's not local at all. i suppose that if one were forbidden all salt one wouldn't notice much more in any one food than in another. eating in general would be different, every day, at every meal. it is like that. the act of living is different all through. her absence is like the sky, spread over everything.or i have always been able to pray for the other dead, and i still do, with some confidence. but when i try to pray for h., i halt.or reality, looked at steadily, is unbearable.it's one of the saddest books i've ever read, since it's absolute naked truth.recommended for: people who have lost someone.not recommended for: invincible heartless space robots with rockets for feelingsa fun book, and very well researched (several hundreds of interviews went into this one), but i can't vouch for its authenticity since i have no clue.i grew up with carmack's and romero's games, getting my first pc (a 386 with 16 mhz and a fancy turbo-button for a blindingly fast 33 mhz) in 1994 was right at the height of their career - i had most commander keen parts, and until this book i didn't even know they were basically the start of the career of "the two johns", both having created commander keen as the first game that allowed side-scrolling on the pc. of course, later i had quake and doom... and once i had a state-of-the-art 3dfx voodoo 3 graphics card i could even play half-life! (or rather, counter-strike beta 4). as you can see, this book makes you nostalgic.the book stops somewhere around the release of doom 3, and on a positive note. but it's fun to see that the "tinkerer"-side of carmack, someone who was always trying to be on the forefront of graphical development, is still going strong - he recently became cto of oculus, a company that creates new virtual reality helmets.the only minor annoyance to me is a bit unfair towards the book: since i now developed a bit of a fancy for algorithms, it would have been nice to read more about these, or even how carmack was able to keep up to date with what research was pumping out in his field (the book glances over technical details for better readability).i guess there are two camps as the audience of this book - one is people who grew up with pc-gaming in the 90s, and the other is people who are into startup-stories or business stories in general; i guess some cautionary tales can be learned from id software's terrible atmosphere and ion storm's failure.lots of pkd's common themes in this - reality is a construct built by our minds, so it's only logical that drugs change reality, including the reality of people who've never taken drugs (similar themes are present in pkd's flow my tears, the policeman said as well as in a scanner darkly).however, this book draws much more from metaphysics and religion, as you probably can guess from the title. the antagonist (?) palmer eldritch becomes some sort of demi-god for all those partaking in his drug chew-z - users are transported to some kind of shared mass-fantasy in which palmer eldritch appears. in a way, the three stigmata is a lot like pkd's valis - it's interesting to read  and at some point it's tripping balls, but you also lose the sense of what on earth's going on.starts out as shadowrun/neuromancer mash-up (japanese megacorps! runs! violence!), then becomes a suspenseful noir cyberpunk thriller - recommended. i am looking forward to this novel becoming outdated.a good non-fiction book clearly targeted towards those who teach adults like university professors, it collects in 7 chapters problems professors face in their teaching - each chapter starts with two small stories of teaching frustration, goes over to what underlies these problems with students, summarizes the peer-reviewed literature, and shows ways for teachers to alleviate the problem in question.it's no wonder that organizations like software carpentry chose this book for their instructors, it's a great crash-course on how to be a better teacher. if i ever wind up teaching at a university (stranger things have happened) i will be "borrowring" from the appendix of this book with useful templates for feedback etc., and i will have to re-read the entire book, again. it's not that long anyway.reading through the chapters i couldn't help but be reminded of my terrible high school years and how the teachers seemed to have actively tried to do everything wrong, with no feedback, one big evaluation at the end of the year instead of small ones, terrible classroom atmosphere, no defined goal of learning, no rubrics, and on and on and on.i would love to read the same book, but with a different target audience - a book that takes all this peer-reviewed, published and established knowledge about learning and bundles it into a manual on how to learn and study "the best" way(s). it would have helped tremendeously in my high school and university years.recommended for: those who teach, and those who like to learn by themselves and would like to learn more efficiently.if you're looking for a book to read as a full-on introduction to r (and advanced r), take this book. not only does it go through all of the basics of the language, it also recommends some modern packages which make everything easier (plyr for example) - with copious examples and "advanced examples".i only have two problems with the book:1) sometimes, the advanced examples are too clever for their own good. they're meant to exhibit the advanced usage of the main focus of the current chapter, but they so often do something exceedingly clever that you first have to go through the code step by step with a piece of paper to understand the basic algorithm. only then can you go on and understand the usage of the data-structure or control-structure in question.2) it can't decide whether it's an introduction or a reference. the book is written and structured like an introduction, but it seems to be on a quest to introduce the majority of standard functions that r has (and they are legion). i'm pretty sure i already forgot about 80% of the introduced functions.interesting short psychological study - you first think pechorin is a gigantic douche, then you learn his inner, cold, nearly psychopathic thoughts, but then he turns around and confuses you with actual feelings, remorse, guilt, despair - only to turn around again! you're left wondering who it is you've just read 150 pages about, and you're reminded that good characters can't be reduced to a single attribute.what an amazing idea - how would life look like if there'd be no third dimension? we read of the narrator (a humble square), who describes his society & life, and how he met the glorious three-dimensional sphere who changed his life... how life works is amazingly well-thought out (though i didn't understand some points - how can there be reading and writing in a two-dimensional context? letters need height!), some great details - for example, women are "just" lines, who are dangerous because they are invisible from the side...recommended for: people who like to think about how things could be.(actually 3.5 stars)details the life of bobby fischer in an entertaining and well-written way - you can find better summaries elsewhere. the only qualm i have is that the author, frank brady, has a personal connection to fischer from fischer's late childhood on and was deeply impressed by fischer. as such, brady is constantly trying to improve fischer's image and sometimes he's just trying too hard - for example, in the match reshevsky v. fischer (the "match of the century"). due to one of the sponsors of the match having different obligations the organizers moved the start of the match a couple of hours earlier, and fischer just wouldn't have that. he simply didn't show up to the game and thus lost it. how does brady describe it?... the "match of the century", as it had been billed, was the unfortunate casualty of bobby's ingrained sleep habits and the long shadow of patronage in chess. (p. 164)no, it was a casualty of fischer being an arrogant brat!anyway, i'd still recommend it, it shows that a) behind a "genius" is a mountain of lonely hard work (i guess "geniuses" don't really exist?), and b) it's always entertaining to read about douchebags.p.s.: there's also an interesting connection to the ongoing snowden-case: when an elderly fischer was arrested in japan for being there illegally (his passport was revoked by the us because fischer committed the crime of playing in the embargoed communist yugoslavia about 10 years earlier) iceland made fischer an icelandic citizen so that japan didn't have to extradite fischer to the us. i guess this is why so many people look to iceland to help snowden? but on the other hand, fischer had prior connections to iceland - he was seen as something of a national hero since he held a tournament in iceland some twenty years earlier, which made iceland internationally known. snowden does not have any such connection.orwell's first novel, a semi-autobiographical description of his time in paris as a poor dishwasher and in london and surrounding areas as a homeless tramp; it reads very destitute, and wikipedia gives a relatively different description of that time (for example, wikipedia says he lived with his parents, so there was always a financial backing if things became too tough). nevertheless, his love for humans shines through on every page; and he still manages to inject humour even when writing about the ugliest people. his descriptions and experiences living on the absolute bottom of society is where his political leanings were born - i think this is also where parts of animal farm and 1984 come from. the book is on gutenberg, but the ebooks@adelaide version is slightly nicer, although there's about 10-15 scanning errors.what a strange, strange story. onoda was trained in guerilla warfare by the japanese army and had been sent to a small island in the philippines to fight the war against the americans. unusual for japanese soldiers, he had been explicitly forbidden from committing suicide and had been allowed to be captured. his orders were to cause mayhem until the japanese army would sent explicit orders or would come to pick him up. that never happened, so he stayed for 30 years until a student found him in 1974.the book becomes most interesting when he describes his mental acrobatics to keep on fighting - other japanese often came looking for him, dropped leaflets on the island, called for him via speakers, but he always found some minor mistake or flaw to convince him that these people were impostors sent by the enemy to trap him. newspapers saying that the war was lost with pictures of japanese in their cities were obvious fakes - if japan had lost, all japanese people, including children and women, would have died fighting! it didn't really help either that the philippine army used the island to train bombing runs (genius idea - train where you know that there are still guerillas hiding) - what would you think if you were stuck in an imagined war, but the planes dropping bombs were real? he never got the official order to stand down, so he never stopped fighting, which he did by terrorizing the poor islanders, burning their rice, shooting at them, stealing from them.sadly, the autobiography is slightly insincere. onoda describes shooting in the general direction of people and never mentions whether he actually hit someone, but wikipedia says he killed several islanders.onoda died just 5 months ago. this book seems to have been forgotten since it came out in the 70s - i got it for a dollar at the lifeline bookfest.recommended for: 1) people who are into survivor manuals. want to know how to store ammunition in the jungle? collect the bullets in a glass bottle, put coconut oil on the bullet to prevent rusting, close the bottle with a steel cap to prevent rats from eating the coconut oil! you're welcome! (the book has helpful drawings too)2) people interested in reading about how your psychology can bend your realityi learned a new way to be sad!reminds me a lot of dostoevsky's notes from underground, except that no longer human actually has a plot (it includes a lot of drinking, prostitutes and suicides, but it's a story nonetheless). it's fun to see my own sociophobic parts in this book again:p. 39:most of all i dreaded paying a bill - my awkwardness when i handed over the money after buying something did not arise from stinginess, but from excessive tension, excessive embarrassment, excessive uneasiness and apprehension.all good art has some truth in it:p. 17:i thought, "as long as i can make them laugh, it doesn't matter how, i'll be all right. if i succeed in that, the human beings probably won't mind it too much if i remain outside their lives. the one thing i must avoid is becoming offensive to their eyes, i shall be nothing, the wind, the sky."nothing much happens, except it's sometimes funny. maybe i'm too young for this, maybe i should've read this back when it came out. this way, the whole "look at our ridiculous culture and our ridiculous jobs and our ridiculous problems cavemen wouldn't have had" schtick feels tired, there's a million books like this now - i guess white noise is to blame for that?this is not really a non-fiction book, but a dialogue between joseph campbell (professor who specialized in comparative mythology/religion) and bill moyers, a journalist. it's all about campbell's lifework, which was to compare different mythologies of different cultures and continents and find all the overlapping tropes - and there's lots to be found.this book shines when campbell starts to tell all these stories from native americans, inuit, hindus and buddhists and shows how they share common motifs and how they are essentially just one big story. it's also great when he criticizes christianity:moyers: in the christian story the serpent is the seducer.campbell: that amounts to a refusal to affirm life.i would've given it five stars were it not for campbell continuously accepting stories as fact, for example:there's a czechoslovakian psychiatrist, stanislav grof, now living in california, who for years treated people with lsd. and he found that some of them re-experienced birth . isn't it amazing that this repeats just what the myth says?now campbell hints here that this is an event re-experiencing something that actually happens, when in reality, it might just have been the drug, no experience necessary. he likes to do this - he often goes out on a leg and states things he can't prove. my biggest peeve is with his central statement of "follow your bliss" - that there's something roughly akin to destiny that is manifested in the things you like. so to be happy you follow that path of your preferences and that is the only way. it's a bit of an unfair thing - if your circumstances prohibit you from following bliss, what then?he's a bit unfair in other parts, too:freud tells us to blame our parents for all the shortcomings of our life, and marx tells us to blame the upper class of our society. but the only one to blame is oneself. that's the helpful thing about the indian idea of karma. your life is the fruit of your own doing. you have no one to blame but yourself. - says the upper middle class white guy who could afford to go to university.nonetheless, i learned a lot about myths and it was a pleasure reading. it's great when he compares the motifs in star wars 4-6 to mythological motifs - and they constantly come back to it! he would've hated episode 1.recommended for: people who get stuck browsing tvtropes.not recommended for: people not interested in the fabrics of societyan interesting structure: each author writes one chapter about a past biologist who struggled with the "general" mainstream or who had a theory that was a little bit off mainstream. thee writing of authors differed profoundly, some of the chapters are a tad dry, with words more complicated than they have to be, but all in all i learned a lot about the history of biology. the chapters are (i think) roughly ordered chronologically, and only by the end had i actually heard about the people the chapters were about (with exception of wallace).i guess this makes the latter chapters more enjoyable, as we can remember the some of the controversies surrounding these characters: gould's , for example, who is still one of my favourite biologists. a word of caution: do not read this book in bed, you will fall asleep!recommended for: those interested in how "scientific knowledge" and especially the status quo are developed. biologists.sex, sex, sex, sex, more sex. that's mostly it. 500-something pages. 3.5interesting structure, the story stretches from the 18th/19th century into the future over the first halves of 6 interwoven stories, reaches the endpoint, and then the rubber band contracts again and the second half of the 6 stories begins, and we end in the past. all stories are connected over minor and major details.the actual stories themselves weren't that interesting except for the robert frobisher novella - specially the two novellas set "in the future" aren't that great, the whole "evil corporatocracy" thing has been done to death, with more nuances, in 80s cyberpunk. each novella is written in its own distinct style which feels never forced or pretentious, and there's enough of the author's ironic self-awareness (at one point, frobisher asks himself if what he's creating isn't too "gimmicky") here to not make the book feel pretentious.not recommended for fans of sf, you will be disappointed.is this where futurama's zapp brannigan comes from? both are "war heroes", both are widely celebrated, both are cowardly idiots with more luck than anything else. the difference is that flashman is even worse, he rapes, he's a huge racist, a backstabbing monster.it's an interesting twist on the classic "colonial hero" like allan quatermain, but with a huge dose of cynicism (or realism?).easily my favorite non-fiction book of the year (so far).it details the life of abraham lincoln from birth to death, focusing almost exclusively on what lincoln thought and did, not much space is given to contemporaries. when there is a quote from an political opponent or from a newspaper, it's about lincoln. in a way, that's good - i can't remember more than five names at once, anyway.it's a relatively thick, very detailed book, but it's never truly dry and boring - rather, the myriads of quoted contemporary sources (newspaper comments, entries from diaries, letter excerpts) give the book an alive atmosphere.did i learn anything? before this book, i thought the american civil war started because lincoln outlawed slavery, and then people died, and then slavery was gone. battles may have involved velociraptors, and at some point bill and ted appeared and stole lincoln thus probably ending the war.in reality, the war initially wasn't about the abolishment of slavery, but about the spread of slavery - lincoln campaigned on a ticket that opposed the spread of slavery, and before he even was inaugurated, the south seceded. interesting! there's a lot of inspiring stuff about the moral background and the rather scientific way lincoln approached each problem - rather than outright stating in his politics that slavery is wrong, he approached the problem from each possible viewpoint to see what each party believes. some of these examinations have survived in lincoln's private notes! very interesting. his humble approach to problems like this, his speeches (that he held mostly himself! no empty congress) makes you feel even more depressed about the current state of democracy.two minor problems: you need to be a bit acquainted with american politics and geography to truly understand what's going on, sometimes the movements of armies are described relative to landmarks like certain rivers (and poor german me has to look at a map), sometimes the complications in us lawmaking are not fully described as this book is about lincoln, not bureaucracy. also: according to wikipedia, that awesome story about hookers being named after the union general hooker and his party-tent during the war (making the recent affair around petraeus seem very boring) is likely not true, the word 'hooker' has been used in the same context before the general became famous :(55 'facts' and 10 'fallacies' on the practice of software engineering: from managing, to planning, to programming etc. the structure is always the same, first the fact in one or two sentences, then one or two pages discussing the fact, then a page of the controversy (criticisms, or opponents of the 'fact'), then some sources. as such, the book is quick reading, you can read one or two 'facts' on the bus.of course, the author's opinions shine through - he really doesn't like vendor salespeople (they hype too much), managers should stay out of the way of programmers since managers don't know what programming is about, etc.some of these facts i've heard by now (the book is, after all, 12 years old), some of them overlap with the mythical man month, some i hadn't heard before, some don't apply to me (bioinformatics programming: where neither plan nor design prevail).just a taste for a couple of interesting facts and fallacies: - projects run late mostly because of faulty schedules and estimates- most errors are errors of omitted coding logic (hard to test for)- 100% test coverage is impossible (this is now widely accepted) and useless anyway- the (average) wisdom of the software field is not increasing (what experienced programmers learn is evened out by newbies arriving, and for a long time the number of newbies is growing)- programming should be taught by reading code instead of writing it (i don't agree with that one - too frustrating to read code if you've never before seen it)- better software engineering development leads to more maintenance, not less (possibly because it's easier to add new features and change old ones)- my favourite 'fallacy': 'software needs more methodologies' - nicely summarized here: http://programming-motherfucker.com/ (nsfw language)recommended for: all programmers.bonus best quote (in itself a quote):reality is the murder of a beautiful theory by a gang of ugly facts.a good book if your into the history of biology (genetics to be exact), and want to learn more about nature vs. nurture - how much of behaviour can be attributed to genes? the book summarizes the beginnings of genetics in the fruitfly, and describes the beginnings of research into the genetic bases for the feeling of time, of sexuality, and for memory in fruitflies. like bastian i didn't know anything about benzer before, so that was an eye-opening experience - and it's cool to read about how all the 'big names' like watson, feynman etc. fit into the history of genetics.sometimes, the author looses a bit of control over his metaphors and, in my opinion, makes the gene -> phenotype connection too simplistic. all direct quotations of benzer do it 'right' (if there is such a thing) - benzer is very cautious in making any comparison between humans and fly behaviour, for example. weiner on the other hand uses emotional formulations like 'biologists who hate sociobiology maintain that we can learn very little about human nature by studying the instincts of other animals' (p 216) - it's not that i hate sociobiology, it's that i think that a lot of people (journalists more than scientists) hype it more than it deserves. weiner presents some examples of genes in human behaviour that by now are outdated, and he gives them more merit than they deserve, even back then. for example, he links xq28 stronger to human male homosexuality more than the evidence of the 90s allows for (imho). in these parts the book clearly shows its age, biology has become more cautious in the last decade. a very recent example is the discovery of how the mere presence of male researchers influences the behaviour of laboratory mice.the biggest annoyance to me was the treatment of lewontin in this book, weiner presents him as some kind of outdated cold war relic, something like the last marxist, a unicorn of science - if i remember correctly, he's the only one given negative adjectives in the book ('he's loathed and feared', p 256). i've read other things by lewontin - he had quite a bit of influence in evolutionary biology that this book omits, he published a bit with stephen jay gould, and his thinking is still influential (and should be more widely spread). i don't think he deserves to be loathed - can someone be loathed who co-invented isadore nabi? but it's still a good book, just take it with a grain of salt (as bastian correctly says) - it pulls some of the 'quieter', maybe slightly forgotten characters of science into the foreground.recommended for: - people who want to know what a single person can achieve in their life with inspiration and lots of hard work.- people interested in the history of science, especially genetics. now that i think about it, isadore nabi should have gotten the first statue of darwin looking doubtful for his essay an evolutionary interpretation of the english sonnet.-----------------------------------------------------------update 2014-7-1:for those interested, one of the chapters describes how the period gene may have something to do with a supposed courtship song in drosophila: last week research was published that showed this song is just an artefact of data binning. here's the blog post by the lead author.these essays require a lot of prior knowledge about existentialism that i simply don't have (yet?). reading it like this i have no clue what he refers to half of the time. have to pick up again in a couple of years.i've seen this book pop up a few times on lists like "recommended reads for programmers" and always wondered why - i didn't know it was such a extremely fascinating read! i tried to read it in one evening but had to stop at 4am.it's the story of how one us astronomer turned computer programmer ("astroinformatician"?) found a 75 cents bill for computing time he couldn't make sense of, how he traced that bill, found an intruder on his system, and how it took him months to untangle the web of systems the hacker used to disguise himself.stoll had a very interesting scientific way in which he approached the problem of an intruder, which resonated with me strongly: he kept neat lab-books of everything that happened, he thought clearly about each step, and all the little details they used to infer more about the hacker are splendid.for example, on login the hacker kept on using "ps -eafg" to see who was logged in, but "-f" was superfluous under berkeley unix, which indicated that the hacker was used to at&t unix, which  wasn't used on the us west coast. therefore it was more likely that the intruder was from the us east coast, or from abroad.(another fun thing about the age of this book - it's clearly written for the layman in 1989, so things that are completely basic today are explained in long terms - "electronic mail", for example)it becomes a fun cat and mouse game - it's always the same intruder (who turned out to be urmel/markus hess from germany), stoll tried to get the us government involved, but no agency wanted to have anything to do with it - neither the fbi, nor the cia, nor the nsa had anything to do with computer break-ins, there were no laws yet, nothing (the events in this book happen around 1986-87, i was just a few months old).it's great fun to read how each step in the plan worked out, how stoll laid traps, each step in his thinking is detailed (the joys of writing everything down!).you'll especially love this if you (like me) grew up fascinated with german "hacker culture" of the late 80s, early 90s, back when the chaos computer club started to become a name. i got the biggest smile from this little dialogue:"can you identify who's breaking in?""one guy uses the pseudonym hagbard. another, pengo."i'm pretty sure every german "computer person" knows who hagbard was. we've all seen the movie "23", and if you haven't, you greatly owe it to yourself, it's one of my favorite german movies (even robert anton wilson, who co-wrote "illuminatus!", has a small part playing himself). it portrays the kgb hacks from hagbard alias karl koch and his friends, which is closely connected to the story of this book, but the movie focuses on koch, while the book focuses on the systems hess broke in. i guess focusing on koch made for a more interesting story - he had a relatively large cocaine habit, and he was found burned to death, with no suicide note.stoll didn't like the ccc at all - in the book he repeatedly calls them vandals, i guess because back then, it was just a couple of kids messing around, not particularly knowing what they were doing. nowadays the ccc advises the german government on technical security matters. the chaos communication congress is one of the best and biggest technology conferences in germany (i'm proud that i once held a little talk there at an ungodly hour together with bastian greshake/@gedankenstuecke).another interesting side-note is that some currently very famous "computer people" appear shortly - such as paul graham and robert t. morris, who have since then founded several companies and are now known for ycombinator, one of the biggest internet startup seed funding companies (possible more for ycombinator's social news site, hacker news)if you want to read a more technical side of this, stoll first published a paper: stalking the wily hacker.i wonder how much the events in this book, and the book itself, made snowden's revelations possible... would the nsa ever have started to try and control the entire internet if the soviet union had never started to pay hackers for information? recommended for: computer people, those interested in the history of the internet, those who enjoyed playing uplinknot recommended for: people who want to think that the internet is facebookread from cover to cover during a bout of insomnia, opinions may be influenced by that.a strange interweaving of three semi-related stories - the story of the world's columbian exposition/ the chicago world's fair, a temporary exhibition of the world's wonders, europeans may remember the expo 2000 in hanover as something very similar in structure. the second story is the one of h. h. holmes, one of the first serial killers, who built a castle which was by coincidence located very close to the fair. his murders started before and ended after the fair, he even took some of his victims to the fair. the third story is the one of patrick prendergast, mentally ill newspaper distributor, he shot and killed the mayor of chicago on the second-to-last day of the fair .it's such a strange mix: especially in the beginning you wonder who could possibly be interested in a mix of "history of architecture" and "true crime", but around the middle it picks up, you get to learn that the ferris wheel, this staple of country fairs around the world, was developed for the chicago world's fair to "out-eiffel eiffel", that this fair was one of the main reasons why ac is the standard, the fair had its own police force with the task to (wow) prevent crime, not investigate it after it happened, etc. pp.the story of holmes is interesting if you're into "true crime", this story of a psychopath building his own murder castle with gas chambers and kiln. if this were fiction you wouldn't believe it.recommended for: americans interested in their own history, the author often goes into small interesting tangents featuring famous characters of american history (do you know susan b. anthony? katharine lee bates? i didn't; i did know buffalo bill, but only because disneyland paris runs a copy of his show) after columbus, not after the country he was tried as sane because he left the sixth chamber in his revolver empty, in case the gun accidentally goes off.in a way, this summarizes the lifework of kahneman himself.the book summarizes the myriad ways our own minds can deceive us - kahneman uses the model of system 1 and system 2, system 1 are our fast, intuitive reactions, system 2 is the slow, careful reaction for which we have to make a conscious effort to activate.  we're often deceived by the simplicity with which system 1 generates an answer, and this book is full of examples on problems arising from our "lazy" brains. for example, if we think about a person's qualities system 1 will fill in unknown based on how much we like the person (the halo effect). or, during a sale a person makes a unrealistically high starting offer - and even though we dismiss it, our brains base all other thoughts on that "anchor" (so it's called the anchoring effect). the book is full of effects like that - effects which might undermine your sense of reality. only 40-50% of the book is about the two systems - the rest is about the problems economy has with psychology, in which the author makes fun of economy's unrealistic assumptions that humans are completely rational; and the rest is also about the experiencing and the remembering self - we judge events not really on what we experience, but on what we remember, and there are myriad ways to trick or influence these memories. for example, we can "taint" an experience by adding an unpleasant memory to the end of the experience - people automatically judge the full experience worse than before, regardless of everything that precedes the unpleasant memory!the only problems i had: kahneman loves to list examples to strengthen his points, so some corners of the book are slow! also, his relatively dry writing style may be off-putting to some.recommended for: people interested in clear thinking. decision-makers. scientists. politicians.tl;drman, this would have worked great as a comic - most of these characters are too odd, freakish or weird to really work in a novel, but would work in a comic... but it's a novel, and it doesn't really work for me, so i can only give it three stars. i liked it, it's a fun, quick read (took me about a day during a power outage to read it), it has some violence, some fun cliches (clichées?) from and nods to the noir-genre, nothing that overly strains your brain, nothing that you would remember after a year or so.recommended for: people who really enjoy comics, people who need a crime book but are sick of the usual "whodunit"one of these books you can give to kids to hook them on reading, the long ships is the life story of red orm, a wise and strong viking around the year 1000. it's a long rambling hilarious yarn, there's no overbearing structure, it's just adventure (in the form of pirating and pillaging), followed by hanging around at home for a while, getting drunk and fighting, and then a bit more adventure (but no pillaging, only treasure hunting). i'd wager that on average, someone dies a violent but glorious death every three pages.it's a world where death isn't particularly scary, as long as others got a good story out of it and you died fighting everything's going to be alright. for example, one guy with long beautiful hair tells the story of how his hair saved his life. he was captured by norwegians (iirc) who proceeded to cut off their prisoners heads, he asked whether someone could hold his hair while they cut off his head so it doesn't get soiled with blood, so a norwegian agrees to hold up his hair. before the axe comes down, the young man rips his head to the front so that the executioner cuts off the hands of the norwegian. now normally that would be an outrage but here, the norwegians find that "trick" so funny, they set the young man free. who cares if that guy bleeds to death from his stumps! it is a good death.there's no overarching structure, orm's encounters become unbelievable at some point (he just runs into old friends in the most faraway corners of the earth), except for orm's wife ylva women are mostly spoils of the war, and the second half of the book seriously loses in speed, but it's still a riveting read. it's a lighthearted version of yoshikawa's musashi.recommended for: fans of fiction, historical fiction or fun in generalthis review needs a trigger warning.first of all, this is a brutal book, and not an easy read. there's mutilation, murder, rape, and all of these on every second page or so.set in an unspecified eastern european state during ww2, this book details how the 10-year old narrator is separated from his parents and has to survive by drifting from tiny village to village (up until this point it's a lot like ballard's empire of the sun). since he looks marginally different than others he's not welcome anywhere - most think he's either a jew or a gypsy.interestingly, most of the terror and brutality in this book doesn't come from the war itself, but from the brutal stupidity and superstitions of the villagers. ironically, the war saves the narrator several times - the nazi army saves him twice, and the soviet army heals his broken ribs and gives him a home. at one point, the narrator even sees jesus in an ss-officer. it's not really a book about the brutality of war - i'd argue the motif is more like 'those who belong to the group versus the outsider'. the book is full of these manifestations, war is just one manifestation of the theme. every time the narrator arrives in a new village, he is punished for being an outsider. the holocaust itself is being portrayed as outsiders being punished by the group  (there is one brutal scene which describes how the villagers comb the tracks next to the trains going to the death-camps for anything of value, left by the prisoners; the villagers find an escaped jewish woman, but the villagers don't help her escape - instead, is subsequently raped and killed. after all, 'she's just a jew', an outsider). the title-giving painted bird is another manifestation of the theme.is all the brutality in this book realistic? i'd say yes, judging from what i heard in germany growing up. but it isn't autobiographical in the strict sense, which seems to have disappointed a lot of people when it came out (and looking over them, some goodreads reviews still seem to assume that it's autobiographical). if it were strictly a true story then life has more symbolism than i remembered. but that doesn't mean that the book is untrue - all of these things happened.recommended for: i'm not sure, honestly.not recommended for: fans of the book thief. the squeamish. those who believe in humans.it took me what, 7 months to read this book? it's a massive book trying to summarize the history of knowledge in the 20th century, ending with the rise of "pop-science-books" and starting with the history of the 20th century is not easy and as such, this book is not really "bed-lecture" to be easily digested: it's not uncommon that the authors throws ten names at you in one paragraph. sometimes the ideas are hard to comprehend, but watson always does a good job to explain everything in laymen's terms, from arts to literature to economics to biology to physics, not much gets left out. but the book keeps on throwing knowledge at you, there is no time wasted - i feel like i stored maybe 1% of the contained knowledge in my brain. during reading i got the impression that this book focuses mostly on the west's ideas and concepts, and watson has a few apologetic paragraphs on this in the end, explaining that most of the new concepts that led us into this golden age have indeed developed in the west - i can't really debate him on that. i'm a biologist, and most of our groundbreaking stuff (dna-helix, pcr, sequencing machines..) have indeed been developed in the west. i did enjoy some takedowns, for example i've been taught in high school that freud was mostly right (german classes! a lot of mann's and other german authors' works draw heavily from freud's (dream-)symbolism!), but here the evidence to the contrary is presented (jung was wrong, too). one of the biggest takeaways i took from this book is how no idea comes about on its own - everything is based on previous ideas, nothing is 100% new.i would recommend this book to everyone eager to learn where our "modern" ideas (or mental models?) come from - definitely not recommended for people who can't concentrate for longer than 5 minutes.a book that made me very happy, this one details the life of paul erdős (with two thingies on the o), arguably the most important mathematician of the 20th century, his works & achievements, and his more than, um, quirky lifestyle. he had little possessions and like a world-citizen he travelled from collaborator to collaborator's couch, staying at each house for a few weeks until another theorem was proven.since it's a book about an influential mathematician, pretty much all of the greats of mathematics show up, so the book doubles as a history of modern mathematics, starting with gauss. if you're into maths some parts of the books might bore you, as the book often sidesteps to explain the background of a particular proof or problem, which you'll probably have heard of already. if you're not into maths, the book might kindle a new love for you, who knows. the author clearly works to make the proofs and conundrums understandable for 'ordinary' people.erdős was clearly full of love, always visiting mathematicians' mothers, looking after other peoples' children, never very caring about the order or status of collaborations on papers' authors , eschewing wealth and stability for a life of doing what he loved, often donating what money he had to a particular cause he read about in the newspaper, or sending it to struggling mathematicians. in that regard, the book's title isn't that well-chosen, it's probably based on his lack of romantic and sexual love - the book hints towards a severe phimosis or something similar, and a general lack of understanding of women. the book shines in fun anecdotes about erdős' life - he buttered his first bread at the ripe old age of 21, he never had a driver's license, he was extremely dependent on his mother, he usually gave away what little money he had, he got lost on a 5-minutes walk, on seeing the solution for the monty hall problem he got angry and didn't understand it for a few days (that made me feel better - that particular solution is so counter-intuitive, i'm still not sure i understood it), he called children epsilons, god the supreme fascist, women bosses, he read only one fiction novel in his life (flatland, what else?) and more..recommended for: people who like interesting people.not recommended for: heartless robots. i can talk for hours how picky scientists can get about that, entire projects with hundreds of scientists have been severely delayed because some ego insisted on being author nr. 12 instead of 13. it's one of the more annoying aspects of scientific work.p.s.: i want to steal his epitaph: 'finally, i am becoming stupider no more'wonderful biography of srinivasa ramanujan, one of the most "romantic" figures of the history of mathematics and science - born relatively poor, no contact with universities, shut out due to an extremely rigid system, no training in mathematics, a pure autodidact who somehow managed to come up with novel and outstanding results but was seen as a bit of a crank, then was invited to the uk by hardy to finally come in contact with the greats of mathematics, finally got recognition, published a slew of highly original mathematics, but then he caught tb and died at age 33.the book doesn't come close to his genius, but that's something that baffled even his contemporaries. since ramanujan died so young his great contemporary and benefactor g. h. hardy takes up quite a lot of space in the book; i'd wager 40% of the book focuses more on hardy than ramanujan.the book itself is sometimes too american for my taste - indian and british life explained with examples from baseball or horse-races. a rather uncomfortable 20 pages or so speculating about hardy's sexual orientation (who cares?). it also concentrates on the absolute layman as the audience, so you may be bored when the author starts to explain (for example) factorials. then again, this is a hard decision to make as the author - do you make it very simple and get a general audience or do you assume some knowledge and alienate many?edit 2015-11-18: looks like a movie based on this book is screening in cinemas now: imdb page, wikipedia.(here be spoilers)there are many books out there about what happens after an apocalypse, be it through a virus (i am legend, earth abides), through nuclear war (on the beach, wool, a canticle for leibowitz), through extreme weather events (the wind from nowhere, the drowned world, maybe cat's cradle?), and of course through zombies (all of the books published in 2012, at least it feels like that). post-apocalypse is such a large "meme" that post-apoc media has its own list on wikipedia: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_apocalyptic_and_post-apocalyptic_fictionthis one has an interesting twist in that it's about what happens before a known apocalypse, it's "pre-apocalyptic", so to speak. a meteorite is on collision course with earth, people know the exact date the collision is going to occur, but not where it's going to strike exactly. people do however know what's going to happen: a massive explosion causing a tsunami, followed by extreme weather all around the globe (remember the dinosaurs?). this knowledge leads to an interesting society, where the market has collapsed, the price for weapons and canned food has skyrocketed, suicides happen by the minute, society is crumbling but governments still exist.the novel details the first couple of months of the freshly appointed detective hank palace, who found one of the many suicides and thinks that something's a little bit off with it, possibly a murder. i loved his character - a bit dreamy and a bit confused about life in general, if he'd work with me in academia he would perfectly fit in. it's his first murder investigation, and even though people around him disappear to tick off items from their bucketlists, he keeps on going, he always wanted this, but is unsure whether he actually likes it. the world is well-built, sometimes it's a bit boring, but all in all i'd definitely liked the book - satisfying ending, too. i recently finished ellis' gun machine and the last policeman feels much more "alive", with characters you'd definitely encounter in any given university-town.recommended for: post-apoc fans, people who like crime-novels but are annoyed by the usual setting.not recommended for: people who can't read about suicide.remember that x-files episode where mulder and scully are stuck on a research station in the arctic and there's this tiny worm that infects people and lets them go on murderous rages? remember how dracula/nosferatu starts with the coffin full of earth on the ship with a dead crew?this is both together! (except that it's a plane and not a ship, and instead of mulder & scully we get some hey-we-hooked-up-once couple working for the cdc) should have checked before i started reading this book, it's essentially a re-telling of dracula in a modern setting, with a bit of biological explanation to vampirism. some of the more scary scenes are well-written (that's why i gave it two stars), the rest is boring and predictable.highly interesting book - in a way, the title is slightly misleading, only about half of the book details the live of the now mostly forgotten george price (was he ever known in the first place?), the other half describes the history of "modern darwinism" - the fusion of math and biology at the hands of fisher, wright, haldane, hamilton etc. for starters, who knew haldane was such a crazy war hero?2 things annoyed me about this book:a) the book is chronologically roughly ordered along the life of price, but sometimes jumps wildly in time (mostly to introduce the life history of a new person in price's life, or of a new important scientist, sometimes it feels the author "forgot" to mention a fact earlier).b) the author seems to be a big fan of group selection, a now mostly dead concept that was already in its last breaths in 2010 when this book was published. especially the second to last chapter feels more like an essay "pro group selection" than a chapter in a biography. mentioning the introduction of myxomatosis to australia with subsequent loss of lethality as a sign of group selection is weird - the more virulent individuals just died faster, leaving the less virulent individuals alive, you don't need to invoke group selection for that (remember occam's razor?).anyway, highly recommended.monk writes great biographies - i loved the oppenheimer biography, and here we have one on ludwig wittgenstein, philosopher of logic, psychology and mathematics, youngest son of the large and prosperous wittgenstein family of vienna.i knew very little about wittgenstein "the person" before, and even less about his philosophy. this servers as a very good introduction to wittgenstein's philosophy - his writing is famously concentrated down to sentences as concise as possible. here you get explanations from discussions with other philosophers, or from lectures he held.some things i noted:- many "famous" names appear here. hitler was in a school class with wittgenstein in vienna for one year; later on, popper, feyerabend, turing are all discussing/fighting with wittgenstein. and of course, wittgenstein's professors at university like russell or frege feature prominently, up to their eventual falling-out.  - monk manages to show all the times wittgenstein himself was weirdly naive without any judgment; i can't see how a 50-ish year old professor of philosophy can seriously entertain the notion of becoming a "manual laborer" in soviet russia ("the life of a manual labourer in russia was the epitome of a life without treacle"). soviet russia didn't really want him, quote monk: "the one thing that was not in short supply in soviet russia was unskilled labour." however, monk defends wittgenstein's remarks to drury on the eve of austria's anschluss to hitler's germany as wittgenstein trying not to worry drury too much about wittgenstein's family's situation. i'm not convinced.- the intense part of wittgenstein's personality is very well portrayed here. it was apparently very hard to be around him or hold "small-talk", and in philosophical discussions his directness was often abrupt to the point of being rude. this is how he wanted to prepare for a wedding:early in the summer he invited marguerite to norway to prepare, as he thought, for their future life together. he intended, however, that they should spend their time separately, each taking advantage of the isolation to engage in serious contemplation, so that they would be spiritually ready for the new life that was to come.as expected, she left after two weeks.- he wouldn't survive in today's academia - he published little to nothing, most is published posthumously. his teaching was kept "under wraps":in order to keep his class down to a size with which he felt comfortable, he did not announce his lectures in the usual way in the cambridge university recorder. instead, john wisdom, moore and braithwaite were asked to tell those students they thought would be interested about the classes. no more than about ten students attended.this is impossible in the age of standardised tests, degrees and the bologna process.- wittgenstein's remarks and monk's expansion about logic and concepts not being as simple as logicians wanting them to be are eye-opening, recommended reading- in his remarks about language i'm reminded of stanislaw lem's sf:this is because the commonality of experience required to interpret the 'imponderable evidence', the 'subtleties of glance, gesture and tone', will be missing. this idea is summed up in one of wittgenstein's most striking aphorisms: 'if a lion could talk, we could not understand him.'most of lem's sf is about mankind encountering talking lions!- wittgenstein's very dry humor is amazing and noted in many episodes like this one:never having seen wittgenstein before, he  assumed that this  was a student on vacation who did not know this hostel had been given over to those attending the conference. 'i'm afraid there is a gathering of philosophers going on here', he said kindly. wittgenstein replied darkly: 'i too'.not sure what to write right now so here's a couple of quotes i underlined:i want to look like you. i want to be so thoroughly anchored into some sort of pop culture aesthetic that nothing can knock me over or wash me away or make me hate everyone. i want to sleep again.raina says nothing's ever really wrong it's just the story we tell ourselves. i think it's the other way around.everyone had a pretty good reason to blow up a building. i agreed with most of them.and they were all like that, macrobiotic belgian trust-fund junkies, park bench anarchists, mean white lesbians in canvas clothing and dreadlocks - each ready to denounce you as a cop at the slightest sign of dissent.i did want someone to do something, and i didn't want it to be my fault. i wanted everything to be okay, everything to change, and no one to get hurt.the world is a violent child none of us will get to see grow up.the saddest book i've read so far; and not sad in a "i have cancer"-sad, but more like "life is misery and the hopelessness will eventually crush you"-sad. good that it's so short.what makes this book so great is the connection i feel to stoner - he starts fights at the wrong time and walks away from them at the wrong time, he does some things wrong and some things right, he doesn't really know what he wants from life, he completely lacks introspection, yet he's still a great character.i am looking forward to re-read this book.recommended for: people who like to drown in common misery. academics.not recommended for: people who belong to the world.you know there used to be this thing in japan called the "sengoku" period which was basically civil war all over the place, the shogun was kind of a loser and every lord of any clan tried to become the leader of japan.this book is a fictionalized account of the life of toyotomi hideyoshi, the guy who finally united the country, first under oda nobunaga and later on by himself. because that life was long and complicated the book is with 944 pages big enough to kill a cat, there's enough japanese names to confuse any non-japanese person (how many names are there? 500? even the main guy's name changes three times!) and it's easily the most epic book i've read in the last 10 years (the internet ruined the word "epic", by the way). the book details the life of hideyoshi from son of a poor country warrior, to wandering salesman, to personal page, to soldier, to leader of a regiment, to trusted retainer to finally leader of the entire clan. there's a billion small stories about a country which attitudes are completely alien to me, one example is: hideyoshi is laying siege to a castle, the enemy's leader doesn't want to give in, hideyoshi doesn't want to lose thousands of soldiers in storming the castle, so he has a messenger approach the enemy general directly, asking him to commit suicide so that hideyoshi can take the castle and everyone can safely go home. the general happily agrees (after all, his family and soldiers don't have to die, and he doesn't loose face), he commits ritual suicide on a boat in front of witnesses, everybody is happy and the campaign can continue. it's weird, but interesting.the style may not be anyone's cup of tea, here's a pretty central paragraph:how boring would be a life lacking the confusions of many digressions or the difficult struggles! how soon would a man grow tired of living if he only walked peacefully along a level path. in the end, a man's life lies in a continuous series of hardships and struggles, and the pleasure of living is not in the short spaces of rest.as you can see, it's a very "grandiose" style, but one that i find makes it relatively easy to read, took me about 2 weeks to read the entire book. there are a couple of downsides - i don't think hideyoshi makes a single mistake in the entire book, which i find hard to believe, and judging from the wikipedia-article on him it looks like his life isn't that well documented that you can safely say "these things actually happened". he's got a couple of mistresses but that's all the "bad" there is to him, the rest of the story he's the most perfect human being imaginable, which makes it boring here and there. one interesting side-effect is that you learn so much about warfare in japan of the 15th and 16th century that the entire movie "the last samurai" is revealed as the complete bollocks that it is. recommended for:- fans of historical fiction or ancient japan, samurais cutting off each others' heads, ninjas murdering people, people who like to read about ritual suicide every 50 pages or so, people who like to see long plans work out nicely- people who like to play total war: shogun not recommended for:- people who can't distinguish "nobuo" from "nobutada" or "nobunaga" (these three are different, but related and quite important characters)tyne daly (an american actress wikipedia tells me) once said: "a critic never fights the battle; they just go around shooting the wounded."if this is true, then thinking about this book is like walking through the trenches of world war i with a loaded gun.logan's run is set in the future, where everybody is just allowed to live until 21 - this is supposed to keep the population down and standards of living for everyone else up. why this also introduced quasi-post-apocalyptic stretches of land with roving gangs of children in what feels like the rest of the world is apparently left to the reader's imagination.how society is supposed to progress when no-one has any time to learn is also left to the reader's imagination. the main guy logan is a sandman whose sole job is to go around and shoot runners, people whose time has expired and are on the run. he is of course perfectly trained for this task - until his time expires and he runs away. how he goes from "system-loving exterminator" to "freedom-lover" is also left to the reader's imagination, it just kinda happens from one page to the other. he is, of course, not alone, being accompanied by a jessica, whose sole responsibility in the book is to be the mirror for logan's thoughts. she's not good for anything else, in fact, she's more useless than a stoned teenager in a horror-movie and, as a character, flatter than a square. her inexplicable uselessness mostly serves to progress the plot. at one point she has to have sex with a bad guy while logan has to have sex with six women (the entourage of the bad guy). i don't know why that happened.this book introduces some sci-fi ideas, but doesn't follow their train of thought anywhere - the story rather focusses on the flight of the pair (which - spoiler! - at one point falls in love with each other, another thing which is an absolute miracle - it's not like they really ever talk about anything, or interact, or grow as humans), so if you're more into action with plot that has more holes than my teeth this book might be for you, but -i don't know who might like this book. people who liked the movie and have some nostalgic soft spot? i never saw that movie, can't tell. people who like cheesy terrible books? go for it! it's quite short (that's good).fun! i mean, look at that name!it's 4 short-stories with the same main character and the same spaceship woven into one book. the main guy seems to be the proto-spock - a guy trained in a new science called nexialism, some kind of "all-sciences-into-one" with hints of individualism/libertarianism with a healthy dose of what science-fiction in the 50s was like (electronic telepathy, mind-controlling, funky big machines etc).each story is about the crew encountering an unknown, but superior alien organism. the first story is a lot like the first alien movie (i think the author sued and got some money), and each time the main guy, thanks to his superior intellect and background, defeats the alien using logic (and his gadgets). it's sometimes amusing to see how he prevails over some of the egomaniacs on board, or how well his long ago laid out plans work out, yet sometimes it's too much deus ex machina for my tastes.still, great fun if you're into old science-fiction, soft sci-fi or when you "love it when a plan comes together".i chose "it's ok".some young people walk around from "organic vegan shop" to the next one, feel lost about their lives, chat with _perfect_ spelling and punctuation on gmail chat, don't know what to do with their time, hang around on their computers until 6 in the morning.all of them seem to be involved in "arts" in one way or another, and of course, all of them are cool kids from a big city. nothing ever happens, nothing progresses (how symbolic of modern times!!11!). one of the characters gets caught shoplifting twice, gets sent to jail for a night where random stuff happens, gets on with his imitation of a life.the language is straight-forward. at times, the way it's written reminds me of a technical manual or a scientific paper - no emotion, nothing in the way, fits the characters perfectly.that's the only good part i can find - i don't need to know more about young people having luxury-problems being "lost in modern life", me and a couple million more people know all about that.tl;dr: all about machines walking around readable in the duration of one train-ride.first of all, this isn't a self-help "how do i live my life"-book, this is rather a long preface to montaigne's essais. so if you're looking for a manual for life, you might have to look elsewhere (try the essais! or maybe gracian's "the art of worldly wisdom"?).this book is a biography of michel de montaigne, former mayor of bordeaux, french statesman and author of the essais, a ~1300 pages long collection of short and long essays (one might say blog-posts today) on all matters of things, from politics of the time to how to live properly like a stoic, that made him famous in his lifetime in the 16th century and is still famous today. in the essais montaigne describes his personal philosophy (without ever calling it so) of a sceptic stoicism (as well as a million other things, from his life to his politics to his sex-life).at times dry and funny,as the modern critic david quint has summed it up, montaigne would probably interpret the message for humanity in christ's crucifixion as being "don't crucify people".at other times horrifying (for example, descriptions of atrocities of the french protestant/catholic civil wars), this book is a collection of questions and short answers which serve as loose starting-points for certain aspects of montaigne's life and works. the book likes to follow montaigne's loosely connected "rambling" style (several times it jumps forward to the death of montaigne, then back to some political aspect of this work, then to developments in modern criticisms of the essais, then back to descriptions of his wife), quite enjoyable if you're prepared to jump around a bit. the book itself is written in a very clear, modern style, i can't find any "stiff" non-fiction-style, which makes for a very enjoyable read. the short rules of montaigne on "how to live" are explained using parts of his writing and his life, but the focus is clearly on his life - so this book rather serves as an introduction of his life and contemporaries, a great preparation if you're willing to tackle the main-part, the esssais themselves. definitely recommended, for people who like biographies of unusual people, people who want to know where modern scepticism comes from, and those who love the essais.it's a strange hit-and-miss affair, this collection - the essays on software design and especially programming languages (and the advantages of lisp) are a joy to read, graham's clearly a great, succinct writer.the essays on society, however, are too "american" for my taste - graham takes a single data-point (often his own life) and then extrapolates from his point to hell and back creating a 100% black-and-white worldview. the very first essay is on "nerds" vs. "non-nerds", i'd say, and is mostly based on his own high school time. the gist of it is that nerds in high-school were the most pure beings and the only "adults" and oh-so-clear-sighted and just forced to put up with this prison called high-school, and how everybody else was and is just an idiot etc. pp. there's also one extremely strange essay on generating wealth that was just written, i think, because graham is rich? it's mostly "rich people earn so much money because they work hard and generate a lot of wealth", yeah, we saw in the last financial crisis how much wealth bankers generate.my advice: skip the society essays, read the programming essays.amazingly boring. big brother with ass-holes in space. stay away from this, but read rama i.interesting book with a pretty narrow focus, a collection of essays on the management and planning of good software engineering. the author instilled the mistakes and successes of his work on the ibm 360 operating system in the 70s, and most of what he found still applies today. for example, wisdom like: more programmers make a project only late, and if you add programmers to an already late project, results will arrive even later. have an architect and a manager, hopefully in two different persons. have version control (since the book is old, it's more of a central repository of printed (!!) books that detail all changes, the outline, the design etc.). there is no silver bullet - software is inherently complex and there will never be a single technology which makes it fast/easy/cheap/error-free.a large portion of the knowledge contained is more useful large companies or large projects, where you have 100 to a 1000 programmers working at the same time, so for me as a lonely bioinformatician toiling on my own code not everything is applicable. but if i look through failed projects at, for example, kickstarter, i realize that they often just repeat mistakes people already solved in the 70s. this review has a good summary of the main points.i'm giving it 4 stars since some of the examples, discussions and problems are clearly outdated by now.short review: some good advice hidden inside victim-blaming ('you get cancer because you're not expressing yourself!1!') and weirdly new age stories about angelsrecommended for: those who have romantic views on the creative process (as in, those who think that you can only create anything if some imaginary muse kisses you first). those who want to learn how to self-motivate a bit more, but there's probably better, more complete stuff out there.i've now read the first three culture books and i will not go on reading the rest - the culture-universe is an escapist setting, which is technologically so advanced that it's basically a bunch of magicians living together.i think banks knew this in writing; which is the reason why 99% of the first three books are about interaction with characters outside of the culture. reading about the omnipotent gods living in their tech-bubble inside the culture would become boring very fast.why it's boring to read - there's nothing to learn or gain for the reader. there are some thinly veiled allegories on mankind, for example the azad in the second culture-book, "player of games" with their useless pride and cruel society. you can find better allegories in other books, for example "animal farm", "the library of babel" or something from saramago. go read these books if you want to learn about humanity.storywise it's relatively straight-forward in all books - someone from inside the culture (or in close contact to it) is sent out to investigate or help with another culture, which is either very interesting or threatening to start a war. the protagonist is usually accompanied by intelligent technology, which safes him or her from most threatening situations using, basically, magic. sometimes the machines fail to make the story "dangerous", but that's it. the main character then goes and solves the conflict using his/her technological wizardry. that's it.i still give it 3 stars: if you like escapism and dislike this world you live on, read these books. great world-building and banks' imaginative mind paired with his storytelling prowess should guarantee that you're entertained.if you want to learn anything, don't waste your time.in short:it's american psycho without the long lists of lotion- and clothes-brands. which makes it pretty good!
