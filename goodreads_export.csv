It was a miracle! Down through the sky, seeming to swell monstrously with the speed of its descent, came a ship all of metal.<br/></blockquote><br/><br/>A spaceship lands in Britain in 1345 right in front of Sir Roger and his knights. The aliens are invaders as their blasters make clear, but they don't intimidate the British, who think they're either being attacked by a French trick or demons. They quickly kill all invaders and leave earth on their space ship, hoping to use it to attack the French, and then to liberate the Holy Land with its power, but unfortunately they land on the nearest home planet of the aliens. Most of the story is about how the British knights use cunning and brute force to take over the whole planet, after which they go on to take over most of the alien empire.<br/><br/>And because it is Golden Age SF, everything is way too easy - this particular intergalactic empire is inept at pretty much everything including hand-to-hand combat, freed alien planets immediately and easily join the rebellion instead of asking for food, death is comic relief, and of course the book is never taking itself too seriously, as it should be:<br/><br/><blockquote><br/>""He does not speak any known language, my lord,"" I said.<br/>""Nonsense! All demons know Latin, at least. He's just being stubborn.""<br/></blockquote><br/><br/>If you enjoy gallant enormous practically invincible knights romp through space while decapitating aliens and praising the Lord, go for it!",,,,,,0,,,,,

The first essay ""Reflections on War"" tries to update Clausewitz's teachings with modern warfare. Eco ""updates"" the model of information flow in wartime, since nowadays it's not two big sources of information anymore. Instead, Eco models this flow as a neural network, where each interested party is a node in a network, with its own interests and impact on the entire network (machine learning says hi). This is a very interesting model - I can't even name all parties who have boots on the ground in Syria, let alone all the international parties who have vested interests. <br/><br/>This structure makes the patterns, shifts, outcomes of the conflict hard to impossible to predict, which is very different from what Clausewitz taught. It's especially fun when you've had some experience with Artificial Neural Networks, which have the same underlying model, but that one is used for training or pattern matching.<br/><br/>The last essay on internationalism and multi-culturalism is great, and I can really feel what a loss Eco's death meant for modern European thought in times of a profound shift to the right:<br/><br/><blockquote><br/>The most dangerous form of intolerance is precisely the kind that arises in the absence of any doctrine, fueled by elemental drives. This is why it cannot be criticized or curbed by rational argument. The theoretical foundations of <i>Mein Kampf</i> can be confuted by a battery of fairly simple arguments, but if the ideas proposed in it have survived and continue to survive all objections, it is because they are founded on uncontrolled intolerance, which is immune to all criticism.<br/></blockquote><br/><br/>The other three essays are less interesting: how to define fascism, and trying to define what all fascist movements have in common (""Ur-Fascism"") - how the Italian press has developed, with some interesting reflections that fit to all all media (""On The Press"") - how morality can develop without a religion (""When the Other Appears on the Scene"").",,,,,,0,,,,,

Goethe complains about how some contemporary writer is bad in this or that way, then Eckermann comes up with an example of how Goethe did that thing much better in one of his plays, and then both vehemently agree for a page or two.<br/><br/>You have to see it this way: a young, self-taught guy from a poor background who has never finished any schooling or higher degree, who yearns for a career in the arts meets a famous man at the end of his life, a man whose time in the mainstream is over, who is maybe yearning for some attention from the younger German generations. The third book is much better, written a few years after Goethe's death, there's more distance between Eckermann and Goethe which leads to a cooler description of what was going on. The first two books spend so much time on Eckermann and Goethe agreeing that I'm surprised there's no slash fiction out there.<br/><br/>Some notes:<br/><br/>- Goethe's theory of color keeps on appearing over and over again (tl;dr: light doesn't consist of all colors, but colors appear when darkness and light mix) - Goethe was very angry that the ""crowning achievement of his life"" was being ignored by the mainstream. There are some fun implications for philosophy of science, and general crank-ism in there. A good theory doesn't <i>explain</i> phenomena, it <i>predicts</i> them; when Goethe's theory's predictions failed, he explained these failures away by saying that the eye is subjective, it ""wants to see what it sees"". Only a few pages later he complains about how no-one wants to ""let go"" of Newton's theory of color, but he couldn't do that with his own theory... [b:Goethe - Kunstwerk des Lebens|18454810|Goethe - Kunstwerk des Lebens|Rüdiger Safranski|https://d.gr-assets.com/books/1378228650s/18454810.jpg|26100930] states that Goethe was gifted a prism which would have dispelled his theory, but there's not a word about it here. The other scientific research, for example into the metamorphosis of plants, worked out better - his methods and concepts like homology vs. analogy are still in use.<br/><br/>- It's interesting how often <a href=""http://the-toast.net/2016/04/19/portraits-of-lord-byron-in-order-of-lord-byron-ness/"">Lord Byron</a> appears - nowadays probably more known as the father of Ada Lovelace, one of the pioneers of computing. Goethe was immensely impressed with Byron, and he discusses Byron's successes and failures over and over again, the most discussed artist here. Schiller appears often too, for obvious reasons.<br/><br/>- I was easily lost in discussions between Eckermann and Goethe about their contemporary literature, much of which has been forgotten - have you ever read anything by August Hagen? Or August von Kotzebue, Friedrich August Wolf, Johann Gottfried Herder, St. Schütze (and many similar ones)? Me neither!<br/><br/>- You get a ""making of"" of Faust 2, which Goethe finished with Eckermann's help in the last few years of his life, including some insights into what Goethe thought about certain elements of the play (there's no specific symbolism behind the names of the characters Baucis and Philemon, just that their situation is vaguely similar to the characters in Ovid's writing), or how much Goethe owed to the Greeks, he kept on returning to Greek drama his entire life.<br/><br/>- It's also interesting how extremely confident Goethe was. Sometimes, that worked out immensely in his favor, you can't just write that many poems, plays, novels, and publish in several sciences without believing in what you're doing. In other times it didn't help - it doesn't look like he could admit errors (theory of colors, again). I wish I could be this much into my own work!<br/><br/>- lots and lots of interesting thoughts on arts, and on his work, the role of Germany, too much to fit in here. Goethe spent his whole life trying to perfect his life, his outlook and his personality, this gave me the first insight into why he's such a revered personality in Germany, and why Nietzsche loved him so much: Goethe was someone who never stopped improving himself. Goethe's personal philosophy of life and religion still has a lot to offer.<br/><br/>Anyway, once you get past all the fawning there are some extremely interesting thoughts and concept to be found here, and I really got to understand why Goethe is still such a towering figure in German culture.",,,,,,0,,,,,

It's clearly aimed at non-philosophers - it's partially autobiographical, irreverent, honest, I'm jealous of Bakewell's effortless lively style, she has got the best explanations of phenomenology and existentialism I've come across. One aim of hers is to reintroduce existentialism to the ""modern"" reader: here was a generation of people who were obsessed with the anguish of choice, with authenticity and ""acting in bad faith"" as a reaction to societal forces. These themes have completely disappeared from modern popular discourse - irony and cynicism are certainly more popular.<br/><br/>I feel that the addition of Heidegger's recently published (and AFAIK not yet translated?)  <href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_Notebooks"">Black Notebooks</a> would have enormously helped in Bakewell's assessment of Heidegger's character - there's more Nazism and antisemitism in Heidegger's ""private but slated for publication in some faraway future"" post-WW2 thought than was previously thought. Another minor thing is that the book noticeably loses focus and energy in the last few chapters, the chapter about Havel could have either been 2 or 3 chapters, or cut completely.<br/><br/>Bonus quote:<br/><br/><blockquote><br/>Heidegger, who admired Celan's work, tried to make him feel welcome in Freiburg.

This is a touching story, especially as it is the single documented example I have come across of Heidegger actually doing something nice.<br/></blockquote>",,,,,,0,,,,,

Both groups aren't black & white: the Alliance is led by war mongers looking to secure votes in order to advance their political careers by military gains, the Empire started out as eugenics-supporting space Nazis but has settled down as a more benevolent kingdom, led by an aged and stagnant elite. <spoiler>There's a third and fourth group which is set up towards the end of this book.</spoiler><br/><br/>The two main characters are young military leaders who clash twice in this book, but they're set up to be constant rivals in the remaining nine books. There's Reinhard von Lohengramm for the Empire, Yang Wen-Li for the Alliance. These names work like uniforms: the Empire is full of fun Wagner space Nazi names like Oskar von Reuenthal, even their ships are named <i>Walküren</i>, the Alliance has a hodge-podge of Chinese, Japanese, German, English, Greek names with their ships mostly named after Greek mythology. This ""trick"" makes it possible to follow possibly confusing space-battles easily, you immediately know who is on what side.<br/><br/>Von Lohengramm is an arrogant military genius who wants to take over the whole Empire, Wen-Li is a military history nerd who constantly wants to go home but is kept on by people who need his skills.

You can see this streak in historical novels (personal favorite: Eiji Yoshikawa's [b:Taiko|336228|Taiko  An Epic Novel of War and Glory in Feudal Japan|Eiji Yoshikawa|https://d.gr-assets.com/books/1348457306s/336228.jpg|1337700]), but it continues in Japanese media to this day (a recent example is Death Note). <br/> <br/>Will I  read the other 9 books? The second book is slated to be released in July 2016, the third in November, with the rest to come based on how much money the first three make. I'd love for that to work out, it's certainly a bold move to go and commission a translation of 3 out of 10 books with a total of more than 3000 pages for fans of an obscure TV show, but in the age of ebooks it's possible to secure a niche in the ""long tail"" of available media.

In other areas he uses twin studies to argue <i>against</i> a gene-centric explanation of various human traits, but since 1993 numerous more (and bigger) studies using twins have been published that show a direct genetic link to various traits. Lewontin is very far in the ""not by genes alone"" corner, and many of the arguments he brings up have since become obsolete.<br/><br/>Sometimes however, he's bringing up arguments ten years too soon - he has arguments against Wilson et al.'s sociobiology that fit to the more modern evolutionary psychology, too: <br/><br/><blockquote><br/>When we combine individual selective advantage with the possibility of kin selection and reciprocal altruism, it is hard to imagine any human trait for which a plausible scenario for its selective advantage could not be invented. The real problem is to find out whether any of these stories is true. One must distinguish between plausible stories, things that might be true, and true stories, things that actually have happened. [...] At the very minimum, we might ask whether there is any evidence that such selective processes are going on at the present, but in fact no one has ever measured in any human population the actual reproductive advantage or disadvantage of any human behavior.<br/></blockquote><br/><br/>Or against the ""gay gene"":<br/><br/><blockquote><br/>First, the sociobiologist makes the assumption that homosexuals leave fewer offspring. This implies a description of human sexual behavior in which the world is divided between heterosexuals and homosexuals, one class that leaves offspring and the other that does not. This description, however, does not correspond to our knowledge of human sexuality. [...]<br/></blockquote><br/><br/>Or on the problems of the then just-proposed Human Genome Project:<br/><br/><blockquote><br/>And an average gene that is, say, 3,000 nucleotides long will differ between any two normal individuals by about 20 nucleotides. Who’s genome, then, is going to provide the sequence for the catalog for the normal person? [...] It would be necessary to look at a large population of normal and diseased people to see if one could find some common difference between them, but even this may not happen if the disease in question has a multiple genetic cause so that different people have the same disease for different reasons, even if all those reasons are a consequence of genetic changes.<br/></blockquote><br/><br/>We've only now started to move away from the ""genome for everyone"" to ""personal genomics"" where everyone's genome is sequenced and analyzed, instead of compared to one reference genome. Here he also describes the problem we're 23 years later facing with genome-wide association studies - we need to recruit a ton of people that show a ""nice"" variation in the trait, and even then all we get is risk alleles, not actual genetic causes. The more genes are involved, the muddier it gets.<br/><br/>It's most interesting when he draws out the ideology behind various biological theories - Darwin's theory of natural selection, for example, can be interpreted in the light of the Victorian image of human society (""What Darwin did was take early-nineteenth-century political economy and expand it to include all of natural economy."").<br/><br/>Similarly, the ""modern entrepreneurial competitive hierarchical society"" with ""the priority of the individual over the collective"" is reflected in reductionist ""the gene did it"" theories that are nowadays accepted by society, but less by science. In other words, ideology subtly influences scientific endeavors.<br/><br/>Perhaps I shouldn't make the error to discuss this book from the point of view of modern science, but maybe from the point of view of how modern society interprets science, because there the ""only-gene""-centric view is still a common thing. <br/><br/>Just have a look at the weekly news - ""fat gene found"", ""gene for colon cancer"", ""gene for gray hair"" etc. pp. None of these genes need to cause these phenotypes, they may just under specific circumstances of the study appear more in individuals with that phenotype (there are various statistical technologies to minimize but not eliminate random influences, such as population history). It's still extremely hard to then find the actual A -> B, gene -> phenotype link. This is a problem since people are getting disillusioned about scientific progress - the news, politics, scientists tells them every week how much progress science makes, but they don't see the progress, they still die of the same old cancer.<br/><br/>Anyway, it's not a long read, but it hasn't aged well.",,,,,,0,,,,,

At times one has the impression that it is only the small section immediately before us that falls into the expected pointillistic picture of a city thoroughfare, while on either side, the improvised masquerade is already disintegrating and, unable to endure, crumbles behind us into plaster and sawdust, into the storeroom of an enormous, empty theater.

Nothing much happens - the boy's father slowly looses his grip of reality (maybe he wanders into our reality), and while this happens, all kinds of wondrous and outrageous things happen - a horse turns into a toy, an angry aunt becomes smaller and smaller until she turns into dust, the father collects birds from all over the world until he maybe turns into one of them, the apocalypse is announced only to be canceled.<br/><br/>Reminds me a bit of Ransmayr's The Last World, a bit of Friedo Lampe (both Schulz and Lampe fell victim to random World War 2 violence - one shot in a concentration camp when he met the wrong guard who didn't work under Schulz's protector, one shot by the arriving Soviets when he was too emaciated to look like his passport photo), a bit of that kind of half-dreamed dream you have just before waking up.",,,,,,0,,,,,

The Pirx short stories deal with that aspect - the pilot controls his space ship or lives in a moon colony, but he has to fully rely on his instruments, which (spoiler!) lie due to wrong measurements. 60 years ago that was a bit more revolutionary than today, where we're surrounded by unreliable technology, in a world where the GPS voice tells you to turn right where there is no road, or where we've got ""high tech"" automated assistants who misunderstand our words and call our parents, <i>again</i>, or where the automated threat assessor thinks you're a potential terrorist.<br/><br/>The excerpt from the Futurological Congress deals more with a reality you can't trust due to ubiquitous drugs and walks into Philip K Dick territory [1]. The narrator, who lives in a rich post-scarcity society, only knows about the ""common"" drugs, the ones that make teenagers more rebellious, adults more well-fit, and create moods as the situation demands them - but a meeting exposes him to an anti-drug drug, which reveals <spoiler>that the atmosphere is full of drugs, and reality is much less glamorous than thought - instead of post-scarcity it's rust and dirt and a society in collapse. He is later exposed to yet another drug that reveals yet another layer to reality, which is even worse (an ice-age), and so on, each step revealing a more terrible reality.</spoiler><br/><br/>The essays fit into that scheme - in a world where perfect virtual reality (he doesn't call it that yet) is possible, how can we trust reality? How would you distinguish reality from virtuality (you couldn't, if the simulation is good enough)? How much can you ""be"" Napoleon in such virtual reality without changing the layout of your brain? Wouldn't such a change in layout mean murder, as the original person disappears? How can you convince someone that they're <i>not</i> in a virtual reality, even though you've just disconnected them [2]? The minute that such technology is possible (and despite the hype around Oculus we're still a far bit off) we automatically stop trusting our reality.<br/><br/>We've had these questions again and again in popular culture since then with Matrix and Inception and whatnot, so reading these essays right now are more archaeological fun, to see how much he foresaw and how much is yet to come, how we could deal with that, and to see with what words Lem came up with for concepts that are now common-place.<br/><br/>P.S.: What is it with Lem translations being so much better in German than in English? The English versions are often wooden to the point that it even feels like reading English. Same goes for Strugatsky translations...<br/><br/>[1] Amusing anecdote you probably know: Both Lem and Dick ""worked"" in similar territory, but never met in person, Lem always stayed in Communist Poland. Lem published so many books and stories that Dick thought Lem wasn't a real person, but a communist committee publishing propaganda. He wrote a warning letter to the FBI about that.<br/><br/>[2]   like in that that Matrix fan-theory that says that the rebel's reality is just another layer of virtual reality custom-made for them, which would explain why Neo can later control machines even when he's ""outside"" the Matrix",,,,,,0,,,,,

You get everything: life, many letters, other people's memoirs, the plays and novels themselves, including interpretations of Goethe's major works (one of the best, and again, complete Faust interpretations I've read so far). If you'd want a biography of Goethe, I'd recommend this - some problems where Safranski loves Goethe too much, you could easily write a much ""meaner"", more ruthless biography.<br/><br/>I don't really understand why the Germans love Goethe so much, and I still don't (maybe it's our ""Obrigkeitshörigkeit""/obedience to authority?). He was against the upcoming German state, but after his death the German state used him for his propaganda (as evidence of German uniqueness - similar to Japan's <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nihonjinron"">Nihonjinron</a>).<br/><br/>Some other notes:<br/><br/>- Goethe often wrote to escape his <i>Lebensekel</i> (life-disgust), great word, which is the ""real"" reason of Werther's suicide (not the unlucky love affair as it's often made out to be).<br/><br/>- There's so much about Goethe's disdain for the new industrialism, a world that is ""too fast"" - I wonder how much of that is Safranski writing about 2013.<br/><br/>- Politically he was extremely conservative to the point of being cowardly. His monetary security was completely dependent on Karl August (Duke of Saxe-Weimar-Eisenach, one of those tiny German kingdoms), so he was always for the ""old"" order and criticized the new democracy movements. Very German, I've met Germans who haven't changed their thinking since. Then when the French became the dominant power and Napoleon made Goethe a Chevalier in the Legion of Honour suddenly Goethe was pro-French. Always follow the money.<br/><br/>- It would have been much easier to make fun about Goethe's failed politics exercises. Goethe didn't see himself as an author, but for quite some time as a politician. Karl August gave him an elevated position in government based on personal friendship and admiration, but the large majority of government projects he started and attended were complete failures, partially due to Goethe having been such a political amateur. I can't help but feel jealous of Goethe's secure position - ""GOETHE: hey can I go travel Italy for a year or two while you keep on paying me so I can publish a book about it all?"" - ""DUKE KARL AUGUST: yes, of course, here's some more money"". Goethe was lucky: upper middle-class parents, lifelong admiration and employment by a Duke.<br/><br/>- There's a lot of interesting stuff in Goethe's philosophy about life: you recognize yourself because of the reflections your actions create from others, not from looking inward all day. You even need these reflections, you need others, you can't recognize yourself on your own (funny, typical Goethe's ego: ""don't bother with the reflections of opponents"", but imho sometimes opponents have a point of view you hadn't even considered!). The best life is a pursuit of knowledge.<br/><br/>Similarly interesting the views on religion - reminded me of Einstein's writings on religion, very Spinoza, there is no bearded guy in the clouds, the Godly is everywhere and inside you and is expressed by your actions and work. Everyday actions are an indirect service to God.<br/><br/>- Goethe's relation to science was more than questionable, and hampered by his own ego. He set out to disprove Newton (like that always ends well) and came up with a rather strange explanation of colors (roughly: colors happen when darkness is mixed with light), which he then pushed on anyone. Goethe sent his stuff to Lichtenberg who didn't include it in his physics textbook, which Goethe treated like a personal attack, he broke off all contact. Goethe even received a polarizer as a present, but he refused to use it (fear of having his pet-theory disproven?). If Goethe were alive today he would have one of those blogs ""disproving"" the theory of relativity.<br/><br/>- It's weird how often people got banned from kingdoms back then. Goethe used his influence to have a former friend banned, and others got banned for being too atheistic in public. Then again, German kingdoms were so tiny that a ban meant ""please ride your horse for half an hour in whatever direction, if you really want to come back, write a nice letter"".<br/><br/>- Here Humboldt appears only a few times, curious given that Goethe is such a large part of [b:The Invention of Nature: Alexander von Humboldt's New World|23995249|The Invention of Nature  Alexander von Humboldt's New World|Andrea Wulf|https://d.gr-assets.com/books/1452449264s/23995249.jpg|43595986].<br/><br/>Best bonus quote:<br/><br/><blockquote><br/>Ich habe nichts getan dessen ich mich rühmen könnte, manches dessen ich mich freuen darf.<br/></blockquote><br/><br/>Translation: I have done nothing I could be proud of, but a lot I can be pleased with.",,,,,,0,,,,,

The story focuses on two young people: Isaac is ""book-smart"" not ""street-smart"", Poe is exactly the opposite, and <i>of course</i> they're good friends (if Isaac had no working legs they would be Freak the Mighty). Isaac wants to leave this existence behind and run away from his family and go somewhere where the clocks haven't stopped, Poe tags on for a while, but both immediately run into a catastrophe which takes the rest of the book to deal with.<br/><br/>The language is straightforward with many run-on sentences that work well, but it convincingly manages to create an oppressive atmosphere, you can feel the lack of future:<br/><br/><blockquote><br/>The bank changed the locks and his wife took the daughter to Houston and Virgil's cousin broke into his own house and shot himself in the kitchen. Everyone in the Valley had a story like that - it was a horror show.<br/></blockquote><br/><br/>Sometimes the story makes a few not-so-elegant turns and you can't really decide whether Isaac is supposed to be Rainman or just a smart kid, but still, impressive.

In <i>The Scientist As Rebel</i>, Dyson speculates about how to use genetically modified plants to terraform asteroids - there's a little bit like that here in <i>Dreams of Earth and Sky</i>, notably in speculation about gene editing tools becoming common playsets for children, but that's it - what you get instead is more Dyson putting himself into the contrarian's position to the mainstream: environmentalism is too much ""doom and gloom"", global warming is overstated because the models are inaccurate, plants may take care of the majority of excess CO2, passive detectors may be more useful to focus on than particle accelerators, etc.<br/><br/>What still makes these essays enjoyable:<br/><br/>- most reviews are about books on the history of science (or more general, the history of thought), which is a great way to find some new books to read<br/><br/>- Dyson himself had contact to so many ""greats"" of science that to each biography he writes about he can ""donate"" a few additional personal viewpoints or anecdotes. He visited some of Wittgenstein's courses as an undergrad and hated him back then, he worked under Oppenheimer for 20 years, or this wonderful Feynman anecdote:<br/><br/><blockquote><br/>He never showed the slightest resentment when I published some of his ideas before he did. He told me that he avoided disputes about priority in science by following a simple rule: “Always give the bastards more credit than they deserve.” I have followed this rule myself. I find it remarkably effective for avoiding quarrels and making friends. A generous sharing of credit is the quickest way to build a healthy scientific community.<br/></blockquote><br/><br/>I'm stealing that rule!<br/><br/>- One of the best essays is the one summarizing the US military's  ""secret"" report on insurgents called <i>Oregon Trail</i>, which he had access to when he visited the RAND corporation:<br/><br/><blockquote><br/>The most important conclusion of the Oregon Trail study was that the rebels usually won if the empire spent most of its effort on military operations, but that the rebels usually lost if the empire spent most of its effort on political and social responses to grievances. It was obvious to anyone who read Oregon Trail that the American war in Vietnam was likely to be a losing proposition. Unfortunately, very few people had a chance to read it. By one of the worst abuses of the secrecy system that I ever encountered, the military authorities stamped the whole thing secret.<br/></blockquote><br/><br/>Wish I could read it!

The first book is split up by theme (morality, religion, the state, women etc.) - the second book is more loosely structured. You get a ton of thoughts ranging from a few sentences to a few pages; the best part being that you can see how cleanly Nietzsche develops a thought over a few inter-connected aphorism (and then comes back to it later, only to refute it). It's like reading through Nietzsche's process of thought.<br/><br/>You can see that there's almost ten years between both books; the second half is more mature, has less jokes, but is sometimes more cryptic and harder to interpret, but still, much more enjoyable.<br/><br/>There are some recurring themes that are worth going through -<br/><br/>1) The dream of Europe. Quite often he praises the European idea, of having many nations come together as ""cantons"" into one network of states. To him Europe has a specific goal and task:<br/><br/><blockquote><br/>Desshalb muss jetzt ein Jeder, der gut europäisch gesinnt ist, gut und immer besser schreiben lernen: es hilft Nichts, und wenn er selbst in Deutschland geboren ist, wo man das schlecht-Schreiben als nationales Vorrecht behandelt. Besser schreiben aber heisst zugleich auch besser denken; immer Mittheilenswertheres erfinden und es wirklich mittheilen können; übersetzbar werden für die Sprachen der Nachbarn; zugänglich sich dem Verständnisse jener Ausländer machen, welche unsere Sprache lernen; dahin wirken, dass alles Gute Gemeingut werde und den Freien Alles frei stehe; endlich, jenen jetzt noch so fernen Zustand der Dinge vorbereiten, wo den guten Europäern ihre grosse Aufgabe in die Hände fällt: die Leitung und Ueberwachung der gesammten Erdcultur.<br/></blockquote><br/><br/>Translation:<br/><blockquote><br/>That's why anybody who's European-minded has to learn to write well and always better - it doesn't help when he's born in Germany, where ""bad-writing"" is treated as national privilege. To write better means to think better; to come up with things worthy of communication, and to communicate them; to become translatable for the languages of the neighbors; to become accessible to those foreigners who learn our language; work towards that all good becomes common good and that the free are free to everything; finally, to prepare this now so distant state of affairs, where the good Europeans have their grand task at hand: the management and supervision of earth's culture. <br/></blockquote><br/><br/>You'd like to see that in the EU, wouldn't you? So far all we've done is to misinterpret ""supervision of earth's culture"" as ""let's start Five Eyes, build Echelon and spy on everybody""<br/><br/>2) Critical thought - you should change your opinions, you shouldn't trust anyone, you should be critical towards every thought. You change your clothes regularly, so why don't you do the same with your opinions?<br/><br/>3) There's a very smart part about how much of a self-defeating thing it is that countries are keeping armies ""solely for defense purposes"", as that implies that only the neighbors are the ""bad"" guys and oneself has nothing but ""good"" thoughts, culminating in:<br/><br/> <blockquote>Lieber zu Grunde gehen, als hassen und fürchten, und zweimal lieber zu Grunde gehen, als sich hassen und fürchten machen, — diess muss einmal auch die oberste Maxime jeder einzelnen staatlichen Gesellschaft werden!</blockquote><br/><br/>Rough translation:<br/><br/><blockquote>It's better to collapse than to hate and fear, and it's better to collapse twice than to make yourself hated and feared - some day this has to be the topmost maxim of every society!</blockquote><br/><br/>I'm reminded of the recent reactions to Daesh.<br/><br/>4) On e-mails: <br/><br/><blockquote>Der Brief ist ein unangemeldeter Besuch, der Briefbote der Vermittler unhöflicher Ueberfälle. Man sollte alle acht Tage eine Stunde zum Briefempfangen haben und darnach ein Bad nehmen.</blockquote><br/><br/>Transl.<br/><br/><blockquote>The letter is an unannounced visit, the postman the agent of a rude invasion. Every 8 days you should have an hour to receive letters and then you should take a bath.</blockquote><br/><br/>5) On gender there's quite a lot of outdated thought but at least he ""saves himself"" by stating that this is due to the state of society and not due to some inherent difference:<br/><br/><blockquote><br/>Man kann in den drei oder vier civilisirten Ländern Europa’s aus den Frauen durch einige Jahrhunderte von Erziehung Alles machen, was man will, selbst Männer, freilich nicht in geschlechtlichem Sinne, aber doch in jedem anderen Sinne.<br/></blockquote><br/><br/><blockquote><br/>In the three or four civilized countries Europe's you can use education to make anything out of women in a few centuries, even men, of course not in the biological/bodily sense, but in any other sense.<br/></blockquote><br/><br/>6) The Greeks, Goethe, and arts - Nietzsche has some very strong opinions on art, and sees the Greeks as the biggest humans who ever lived, with only Goethe having come close to their genius (""Goethe was above the Germans and still is above them - he will never belong to them"")<br/><br/>Of course you don't have to agree with anything he states (and a lot of it is outdated and sometimes weird) but it's still a wealth of information to learn, and I assume a good starting point to Nietzsche's thought in general, or as a manual on ""how to structure your thoughts"".",,,,,,0,,,,,

There's a lot about data exchange with other scientists, what we'd call ""open data"" nowadays, and some fun stuff about how extremely active Humboldt was in ""science communication and outreach"" with free lectures and a ton of letters written to scientists and lay people (about 3000 letters per year towards the end of his life).  Then there's all the proto-enviromentalism, Humboldt's views on the abuse of natural resources by humans, his open campaigning against slavery, his ""lonely life"" (refreshing to see extremely little speculation here about Humboldt's sexuality, who cares), the mix of science and poetry, all described by an author who knows how to write and how to structure relatively complicated information for an interested ""lay"" audience.<br/><br/>Sometimes the book goes overboard with the love for Humboldt, from what I've read Humboldt wasn't that much of an influence on Darwin's work, but here  suddenly Humboldt is a bigger influence than Malthus on Darwin:<br/><br/><blockquote><br/>There is no doubt that Malthus provided what Darwin called 'a theory by which to work', but the seeds of this theory had been sown much earlier when he had read Humboldt's work.<br/></blockquote><br/><br/>After description of Humboldt's death the book ends with a few ""mini"" biographies of people somewhat or a little bit influenced by Humboldt, biographies of George Perkins Marsh, John Muir, Ernst Haeckel,<br/><br/>It's interesting how little-known Humboldt is nowadays in the English-speaking world, and I don't know what really caused this - the author mentions anti-German sentiment during WW1, but maybe it was just time.<br/><br/>Recommended for: People interested in (early) history of science",,,,,,0,,,,,

It just works! And you're reading this while a few phagocytes kill off a parasite in your eyes, they just saved you from going blind, and you don't even know.<br/><br/>Parasite Eve fits a bit into the body horror genre (more famous for Cronenberg movies) - mitochondria aren't ""the powerhouse of the cell"", they're parasites that have been waiting from the day of the first phagocytosis. <br/><br/>In the story one of these parasite networks has ""developed consciousness"" (and telepathy and telekinesis and the ability to speak in italics), she's looking for a suitable host and a father of the next generation of ""mitochondrial eves"" (you know, maternal inheritance of mitochondria and whatnot). That father is - of course - a biologist so we get lots of fun details from the daily life of a biologist (there's a fun little bit where everyone's over the moon for just having been published in <i>Nature</i>, and who wouldn't be!). The monster appears like the mother at the end of ""Braindead"" [1], and is then defeated for some lousy reason, aaaand then the book's over, and in parts it's even exciting!<br/><br/>Now to the bad. The first half is extremely, ridiculously, who-needs-sleeping-pills dry. Here's an example:<br/><br/><blockquote><br/>The human body has a main abdominal artery and vein through which a great amount of blood flows. The arteries which supply blood to the kidneys extend from this main artery. Similarly, the kidney veins are linked to the abdominal vein. The abdominal artery and vein each fork out in the lower abdominal region and continue into both legs. The balloon-tip catheter had been inserted up through this lower arterial branch to reach the kidney extension, and the balloons then inflated to interrupt blood flow in the abdominal artery.<br/></blockquote><br/><br/>And that's just a tiny excerpt! You can easily skip the first half of the book and the only thing you'll have missed is an in-depth manual on how to transplant a kidney. But maybe you need to know that? Maybe you're one of those doctors who faked their way into the operating theater, and now you're nervously making it up as you go along? Boy have I got the book for you!<br/><br/>Bonus cheese quote:<br/><br/><blockquote><br/>Toshiaki screamed. Something was being sucked out from the center of his genome. He shouted ""No, No!"" but it was useless.<br/></blockquote><br/><br/><i>No John, you are the demons!</i><br/><br/>P.S.: If your curiosity into mitochondria is piqued, have a look at <a href=""https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/23316494-the-vital-question"">Nick Lane's The Vital Question</a> for a very recent summary (with some speculation) of the research<br/><br/>[1] That movie is called ""Dead Alive"" when you have no health-care",,,,,,0,,,,,

A purely rhetorical question, that: modernity had ended in Western Europe some time ago.<br/></blockquote><br/><br/>I once tried to get into Houellebecq [1], about 10 years ago, and back then his work seems to have been all about ""here's a bunch of sex with various people, oh no this is not fulfilling, we need monogamy, the end"". Not that interesting. The Map and the Territory does not fit into that pattern at all, luckily, it's more a character study of two sides of the same coin - Jed and Houellebecq himself, the first some kind of visual artist who drifts from photography to painting, the second a relatively successful French author who's hired to write the introduction to a catalogue of Jeb's work. <br/><br/>Both are extremely similar with little attachment to ""real life"", both have little to no friends and are drifting through life. Both have found success without really aiming for it, both just made their art when it came to them with no real aim to become rich or famous with it. <br/><br/><blockquote><br/>There was truly in Beigbeder, as far as he could remember, something which could arouse affection and, already, the existence of “loved ones”; something that did not exist in Houellebecq, nor in him [Jeb]: a sort of familiarity with life.<br/></blockquote><br/><br/>France, culturally and linguistically, always feels like a bit of a self-imposed island to me - the French language is imposed by law, and French modern books focus more on navel-gazing than anything else. Houellebecq nearly walks into that trap with a bit of too much satire of the French cultural elite, but he luckily looks past France. There's a bit of history of computing and Silicon Valley, Tocqueville, especially surprising to find a reference to Hakim Bey's Temporary Autonomous Zone. He even touches Jack Womack's territory in a few lines where some areas in Paris have devolved into some kind of proto-anarchy; but where Womack then walks into these territories and stages laser axe-fights between hopped up 13-year olds and Robocops, Houellebecq just mentions them and immediately leaves to focus on his characters. I guess this is something H. revisits in Soumission, I yet have to read that one.<br/><br/>The last third is a bit unnecessary, <spoiler>there's a brutal murder, and sadly the murder is resolved, and even more sadly the murderer is dead so that no (psychological) explanation is necessary</spoiler>, almost as if H. didn't know how to end the story.<br/><br/>[1] That first ""e"" has no earthly business in a last name",,,,,,0,,,,,

The central thesis is that statelessness is a prerequisite for murder on such a scale, evidenced by the fact that Jews as citizens of functioning states (even of Germany) survived in greater numbers than Jews of destroyed states, such as Poland.<br/><br/><blockquote><br/>If Jews were to be removed from the planet, they first had to be separated from the state. As she [Hannah Arendt] wrote later, “one could do as one pleased only with stateless people.”<br/></blockquote><br/><br/>On the way Snyder tries to right some myths - like the one that only Nazis killed in large numbers yet the Nazis managed to usually recruit the local population, or that the United States intentionally rescued Jews from genocide (the US gave 4,705 visas to Jews from July 42 to June 43, less than were murdered per day in 1942 in Treblinka).<br/><br/><blockquote><br/>Age-old antisemitism cannot explain why pogroms began precisely in summer 1941. Such an explanation ignores the suggestive fact that pogroms were most numerous where Germans drove out Soviet power, and the obviously material fact that the instigation of pogroms in such places was explicit German policy.<br/></blockquote><br/><br/>The latter is explained with psychology - citizens who used to collaborate with the Soviets could ""clean themselves"" in the eyes of the Germans by participating in Pogroms - ""The Judeobolshevik myth, spread locally by militias, provided the perfect escape route for most Soviet collaborators"", a collective rewriting of history, it wasn't the Soviets, it was the Jews, with the added bonus of being able to take the houses and belongings of the murdered Jews.<br/><br/>Psychology plays a large part in the last third, which is more positive - why did various people and groups save Jews? It's almost as if the author included these parts to save his own belief in humanity.<br/><br/>The last chapter ""Conclusion"" is all about what we can learn from this - part of the panic that gave rise to Hitler was rising prices for food, which was much more expensive than nowadays thanks to the Green Revolution (Norman Borlaug is severely under-appreciated). We face similar problems with climate change, and if we don't change, we may fall into the same trap. We can't afford to chip away at the states, either in the name of neoliberalism, or in the name of the Left. We need states and their institutions:<br/><br/><blockquote><br/>When states are absent, rights—by any definition—are impossible to sustain. States are not structures to be taken for granted, exploited, or discarded, but are fruits of long and quiet effort. It is tempting but dangerous to gleefully fragment the state from the Right or knowingly gaze at the shards from the Left.<br/></blockquote><br/><br/>I could pull out quotes all day.<br/><br/>P.S.: Bonus-quip:<br/><blockquote><br/>The righteous few were behaving in a way that a norm based upon economic calculations of personal welfare would regard as irrational.<br/></blockquote><br/><br/>P.P.S.: Did you know that Poland funded many early Zionist (and militant Zionist) organizations? I didn't! The history of these small paramilitary organizations like Betar forms a small, but very interesting part.<br/>",,,,,,0,,,,,

Extremely interesting to see this clash of cultures from the ""other"" side - ""our"" extremely brutal fighters with little moral qualms, slaughtering everyone in their path in most brutal ways, the ""early"" Arabs being wholly unprepared and completely confused by so much religious zealotry. Especially the epilogue, linking this story to modern developments of the 1980s, 1990s makes it worth reading.<br/><br/>Some notes:<br/><br/>- Wonderful words used: ""panegyrists"", ""quinquagenarian"", ""suzerainty"" etc.<br/><br/>- <i>Franj</i> medicine and judiciary, what a weird mess. Got a disease? Let's cut a cross into your scalp and pour salt on it. Oh, this kills you? ¯\_(ツ)_/¯ (Then again, there's at least one review here that says the relevant quote is cut to make it seem more extreme, but the relevant link is dead and not on Google)<br/><br/>- Saladin is portrayed as an extremely generous leader, someone who didn't slaughter or sell the population of a fallen city. However, was the generosity worth it? It made him look benevolent, and no plundering meant no income from the war. His pardoned enemies quickly regrouped, after his death his empire immediately fell apart, and the <i>Franj</i> regained some of their strength. On the other opposite, the concentrated brutality of the Mamluks was the force that after 200 years finally drove the Crusaders/Franj out of Near East.<br/><br/>- The Sunni/Shia conflict features prominently - and it still features prominently in our times, virtually unchanged.<br/><br/>- The sacking of the Assassin's library in Alamut makes me more sad than it logically should, so much unique knowledge lost (unlike the Library of Alexandria, which had copies of most of its content in other cities). <br/><br/>- Straight out of Sun Tzu's ""Art of War"", there are at least 20 cases where group A corners group B, and group B fights so full of despair that group A is routed. See for example Zangi's siege of Damascus.<br/><br/>- Most of the initial success of the First Crusade was more due to Muslim infighting, confusion, and political instability than due to any strategic or technical superiority (except for the Crusaders' full-body armor, which was worn only by the rich knights of the army).<br/><br/>Recommended for: Those who'd like to take up a different perspective from time to time.",,,,,,0,,,,,

It goes from the basics, to using the query language Cypher, to some use-cases, internal technologies, and a quick primer on graph algorithms (Dijkstra's algorithm, A*).<br/><br/>Very American, the tone is overenthusiastic to the point of being hilarious:<br/><br/><blockquote><br/>[...]graph databases lack the kind of schema-oriented data governance mechanisms we're familiar with in the relational world. But this is not a risk; rather, it calls forth a far more visible and actionable kind of governance.<br/></blockquote><br/><br/>Translated: It's OK to give children live hand-grenades. But this is not a risk; just give them some rules for handling explosives.<br/><br/>It's similar overenthusiastic in the benchmarks, and there's an absolutely unholy code-example showing how to extract all nodes from a range of dates with no comment that a whole page of code with several MATCHes for a date1 <= x <= date2 is a <i>bit</i> too complicated. Then again, the authors made the database and work for the company that makes all of its money with Neo4j. At times the book feels more like a company white-paper.<br/><br/>The later chapters get more interesting - testing using Java, technical details of the implementation, algorithms, architecture patterns, caching etc. I would have liked more technical details but these are out there (and there are a few useful paper and book recommendations, here too!)<br/><br/>Recommended for: People who want to get their feet wet with graph databases, but don't want too much of the technical details",,,,,,0,,,,,

Lovecraft, and it shows - both ""universes"" overlap a bit (the Necromonicon and Yog-Sothoth make an appearance here, for example), but Smith also came up with his own books. There are two differences: Smith vocabulary [1] is humongous compared to Lovecraft. Where everything ""moves blasphemously"" for Lovecraft, Smith does this:<br/><br/><blockquote><br/>All the hideous things that had swarmed upon me beneath the cacophonous beating of those accursed gongs, drew near again for a moment; and I looked with fearful vertigo into hells of perversity and corruption. I saw an inverted soul, despairing of good, which longed for the baleful ecstasies of perdition. No longer did I think him merely mad: for I knew the thing which he sought and could attain; and I remembered, with a new significance, that line of Baudelaire's poem - ""L'enfer dont mon coeur se plait.""<br/></blockquote><br/><br/>(which, by the way, is a misquote as the footnotes explain). <br/><br/>Smith has a much better rhythm and feels much more natural to read, compared to Lovecraft who often feels clunky or forced. But, Smith just isn't as original in ""worldbuilding"" as Lovecraft - contrary to Lovecraft Smith's stories are often set in a relatively generic fantasy world in which some evil wizard does something evil (for added strangeness everybody's name starts with an X or a Z), stories that could have worked in One Thousand and One Nights, but feel weird and not very original coming from a relatively recent American author. I felt similar about the prose poems and the poems, but Smith's language makes it worth.<br/><br/>However, Smith's overflow of adjectives and adverbs doesn't always work out:<br/><br/><blockquote><br/>Xeethra plunged incontinently into the dark cave.<br/></blockquote><br/><br/>Recommended for: Fans of Lovecraft, or those who love overflowing language<br/><br/>[1] As a side: The German word ""Wordschatz"" is so much better than your ""vocabulary"". ""Wordschatz"" literally means ""treasure of words"", a much more apt description.",,,,,,0,,,,,

If you're into neither then this is definitely not for you.  There are some thoughts on famous English-language writers (especially the answer on Hemingway is great, basically: he's so popular in Germany post-1945 since he's makes for great reading when you've just lost a war.

Can you look at evolution not through the lens of (population) genetics but through the lens of biochemistry, specifically, energy. Lane starts at the ""beginning"" - how come the last common eukaryotic ancestor already possessed so many complicated traits? He goes to introduce an origin of life that depends on energy in the form of protein gradients, and argues that life depending on protein gradients can only evolve under very constrained circumstances - therefore, life on other planets should evolve very similarly (I'm reminded of Gleick's The Information, making similar points about the development of writing). From there he goes on to hypothesize about the evolution of complex(er) cells, the interaction of mitochondrial and nuclear genomes in the development of different life-spans and sexuality, and more.<br/><br/>There's a tom of interesting stuff here, it's definitely a novel perspective.<br/><br/>Some pet-peeves remain: for example, like Dan Brown Lane can't introduce scientists without giving them a positive adjective like ""eminent"" - you can't help but feel a bit ""propaganda'd"".

It's not really ""hard-boiled"", for that the dialogue and humor is too absurd - it would, however, work very well as a stage-play. Some people do get murdered, some get shot. At times it's more like Douglas Adams' ""Dirk Gently's Holistic Detective Agency"" (as when Doan describes how he makes his money), at other times it dabbles in hard-boiled (unassuming strangers are found to hide some deadly weaponry). Sadly the ending pans out exactly as expected, and overall there's nothing ""new"" here.<br/><br/>I originally found this in Monk's biography of Wittgenstein with the note that it was Wittgenstein's favorite fiction book. As with so many books, it's hard to tell from afar why someone loves a book. Sometimes a book finds you at exactly the right moment, and others won't understand. I still love Rosendorfer's Great Solo For Anton and as far as I know it's forgotten and out of print, interesting to no-one.<br/><br/><blockquote><br/>""Mr. Doan,"" Janet said, worried, ""are you sure you feel alright?""<br/>""Marvelous,"" Doan answered.<br/>""Well, I've never had much experience with intoxicants.

According to him, Germany suffers from the rise of the ""mass-man"", the cog in the wheel without ""Selbstreflexion"", without care for his past or culture:<br/><br/><blockquote><br/>Mass-man moves, robotlike, from digestion to sleeping with his peroxide-blonde females, and produces children to keep the termite heap in continued operation. He repeats word for word the incantations of the Great Manitou, denounces or is denounced, dies or is made to die, and so goes on vegetating. And there is not even a blush when he is confronted by the legacy of his fathers, by the monuments of a noble past, by the crowning achievements of his own culture.<br/></blockquote><br/><br/>He hates Hitler and the NSDAP for their ""Prussianness"" (Reck styles himself as a anti-Prussian Bavarian, which still has the wonderful ""Saupreissn"", pig Prussians), their loud, blind and empty core, he hates the all-encompassing belief technology, he thinks that parliaments are chaotic and useless, he loves the Scholls - both for knowing how to live and knowing how to die - but he dislikes the soldiers around the Stauffenberg plot for doing too little too late, after the military itself allowed Hitler to rise to power.<br/><br/>The annotation in the NYRB edition does a good job of picking up when Reck repeats unsubstantiated rumors as facts, and the afterword on Reck's ""game of the self"" is splendid. However it doesn't translate (or even note) some peculiar German turns of the phrase like ""trained in Radau"", which doesn't mean a city but more ""trained in noisemaking"".<br/><br/>Recommended for: People interested in the Third Reich; people who're sick of reading ""the usual"" about this time and would like a unique perspective<br/><br/>P.S.: How can it be that I can easily buy the English translation of this in Australia, but there's simply no ebook in German?

He communicated with his servants by writing them notes, wherever possible; and there are several stories about how on unexpectedly encountering a woman he did not know, he would shield his eyes with his hand and literally run away.<br/></blockquote><br/><br/>Since the author himself is a astrophysicist the focus is a bit more on physics, cosmology and astrophysics than on medicine or biology - two chapters are on biology (one on Lyell -> Darwin -> Wallace, one on Mendel -> many more I haven't heard of before (nice! Ever heard of Miescher?) -> Crick/Watson), only one part of a chapter is on medicine, one chapter on geology, the rest is physics (but that is a truth of the history of science - for a long time, Western scientists focused more on the stars and mechanics than on the human body).<br/><br/>Some more aspects I noted:<br/><br/>- Science shifted from a (often rich) gentleman's hobby to a full-time profession sometime around Darwin's life. I got nostalgic for a time where you could just work your whole life for a king without having to fill out grant applications every few years; but then again, you'd be dependent on the king's whims and mortality. Plus, with only a few outliers it was practically impossible for a ""poor"" person to even begin with scientific work.<br/><br/>- The descriptions of Galileo's and Bruno's troubles with the church are great - none of the usual ""martyrs for science!"" stuff, more (correct) focus on political and theological problems here. The history of scientists has, weirdly enough, quite a few <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arianism"">arians</a> in it.<br/><br/>- Gribbin goes through great pain to make it clear that to become ""a name"" in the history of science, it's often not some mythological personal genius, but luck of being the right hard-working person at the right position at the right time. He often details the people who also made the important discovery at the same time as the ""famous"" discoverer made it, but for some reason, have been forgotten by history.<br/><br/>- Fallopian tubes are called ""tubes"" even though Fallopio originally described them as ""brass trumpets"", i.e., <i>tubas</i> - ""tubes"" is a mistranslation.<br/><br/>- Gribbin is no fan of Newton - although his discoveries were manifold and important, his rather extreme personality made work for other scientists very hard, and the cult of Newton's personality after Newton's death kept progress in some areas of science behind. Gribbin correctly points out that Newton didn't receive the knighthood for his scientific advances, but as ""a rather grubby bit of political opportunism by Halifax as part of his attempt to win the election of 1705"".<br/><br/>- Especially towards the end this book gets more dry, almost as if Gribbin had a deadline coming up and slogged through writing it<br/><br/>- Dalton discovered colour blindness, as he himself suffered from it. Imagine making that discovery!!<br/><br/>- Gribbin's not a big fan of Kuhnian scientific revolutions, as the structure and the afterword of this book make it clear. To him, scientific progress is developed ""essentially incremental, step-by-step"".<br/><br/>Recommended for: Scientists, people interested in history or the history of science",,,,,,0,,,,,

On his floor, just two doors down, is a dying Feynman, not far from that, Murray Gell-Mann's office - the relationship between both as well as their relative outlook on life is the undercurrent of this book, with a larger focus on Mlodinow's tapes of his conversations with Feynman (including many direct quotes). If you've read Feynman's autobiography, then you won't discover much new here - the outlook Feynman describes here has been thoroughly. <br/><br/>There are some choice quotes though:  <br/><br/><blockquote><br/>""But the theory has been around for fifteen years"", I said. <br/><br/>""Okay"", he [Feynman] said, ""So not only is it bullshit, it is old bullshit.""<br/></blockquote><br/><br/>On the basis of his promising thesis Mlodinow got a very strange job at Caltech - no supervisor, no grant attached to a specific project, no teaching, pure research freedom. Personally I'd say that would work amazingly with 10% of all scientists - the other 90%, including me, would turn into a pillar of salt from pure stress. The ""pep talk"" described here given by the head of school listing all these famous Nobel Prize winners just would make everything worse, and I could only nod when Mlodinow described his gradually worsening impostor syndrome (""what if my thesis was just a one-off outlier?"").<br/><br/>What he describes here is how he started to think of the role of a scientist and science (a bit late!), and how the gruffy conversations, in contrast to Gell-Mann's outlook, helped Mlodinow shape his outlook on his work and life. He actually quit science and went into writing for TV!<br/><br/>I'd have given it five stars if the language wouldn't wander off too far into the formulaic soap opera language (""I found the answers I sought about the nature of science and the scientist. But more than that, I discovered a new approach to life"").<br/><br/><blockquote><br/>""Go look at an electron microscope photograph of an atom, okay? Don’t just glance at it.

It's hard to classify this as non-fiction - the Gods still exist and have power, but contrary to (for example) the Odyssey, they've taken a backseat. Instead of mingling with the mortals, their power is indirect; all those who do wrong are correctly identified and punished:<br/><br/><blockquote><br/>No sooner had they blinded Euenius, however, than their livestock stopped giving birth and their soil turned similarly barren. When the Appollonians asked [the oracles] at Dodona and Delphi the reason for the calamity they were experiencing[, both gave the same answer]: that they had unjustly deprived Euenius, the guardian of the sacred flock, of his sight.<br/></blockquote><br/><br/>The oracles are always right - except when they're bribed and then themselves duly punished - their prophecies always come true, often in ironic ways, as known from Oedipus.<br/><br/><blockquote><br/>If you attack you will destroy a great empire.<br/></blockquote><br/><br/>Reading this is often like reading through an ancient Wikipedia, since Herodotus lists as many facts as he could collect. Like Wikipedia's links, every time Herodotus mentions a new place or a thing he can't help but immediately list everything about it, with the consequence that this reads like a phylogeny of stories, with branches branching off other branches, as if you'd replace all links in the Wikipedia by their respective articles' texts. You have to be careful when reading this, if you're tired when reading Herodotus' frequent sidetracking will confuse you.<br/><br/>Funny enough, it takes Herodotus about 6 or 7 of the 9 books until the ""action"" of the wars really starts; before that, he draws a picture of his world as complete and detailed as possible, knowing that this all will be lost and forgotten if not for his work. Book 2 is all about Egypt and what an amazing place it was, book 4 is about the Scythians and their customs. Darius, King of Persia and first enemy of Athens appears in book 3 - he dies in book 7, to be followed by Xerxes, who subsequently raises the biggest army the world had ever seen, literally drinking rivers dry, and their subsequent bloody run-in with the Spartans (here often Lacedaemonians, after the region of which Sparta was the capital) at Thermopylae under Leonidas (you know the comic and movie) and the subsequent defeat of the Persian fleet by the Greek fleet. <br/><br/>In between there are numerous speeches, fights, customs, small stories, rapes and brutal murders, intrigues, bribes, lootings, valorous acts in battle, stupid decisions, hilarious events, and philosophies.<br/><br/>Herodotus himself has a strong voice and judges the stories as told to him by others; sometimes highly skeptical, sometimes blindly trusting (in which case Holland's footnotes play the skeptic's part). By the way, the footnotes are numerous and extremely helpful in locating cross-references by Herodotus (or these cases where Herodotus says ""I'll talk about this later"" and then forgets all about it). In my ebook version with my font and size settings, the book ends at 68%, the rest is footnotes.<br/><br/>Recommended for: Everyone.",,,,,,0,,,,,

It quickly spreads over earth and kills 99% of mankind, civilization disappears. <br/><br/>If you're looking for more post-apocalyptic lit, this may not be your best bet - the book isn't very much concerned with the setting itself, it's not as dark as [b:The Road|6288|The Road|Cormac McCarthy|https://d.gr-assets.com/books/1439197219s/6288.jpg|3355573], for example.

Even though so many divers die during the story you can't help but want to join them in their quest...<br/><br/>From there, it drifts off - there's a very unnecessary chapter describing what the author thinks the crew did before they embarked, for some reason there's of course not a single Nazi on board, everybody's against Hitler, the old cliches.

Over a few years the reader follows the new settlers in the harsh conditions, as they try and make a living off the new land. All of them are trying to start a new life, but the harsh conditions take and take and rarely give. Bears, panthers, snakes and diseases attack the settlers and take their stock, yet the settlers carry on.<br/><br/>The narrator's language is direct, reminding me of Blood Meridian or Butcher's Crossing, often echoing the language of the book's inhabitants:<br/><br/><blockquote><br/>“There are no birds here,” she said. <br/>“Oh, yes,” he said, “the birds are here.” <br/>“I locked that door when I come in, and the smoke keeps birds out of the chimney.” <br/>“I feel their wings. Listen to them fly?” <br/>She listened. “I hear the fire, that’s all.” <br/>“Oh, no,” he said, knowing he would die.<br/></blockquote><br/><br/>Besides all the harshness, there's a peculiar brand of American optimism here - the kind that says ""I need to start something <i>new</i>"" and ""there is no place for me in the old and established"" (again: something which, to me, is nowadays  found in post-apoc fiction). It makes for great reading.",,,,,,0,,,,,

I'm not sure why you should read these - they're more readable introductions to Popper's work, but if you've read Popper (or of Popper) before, you won't find that much new in these essays.<br/><br/>You can clearly see why Gould wrote the introduction for this, this is where Gould's writing is coming from (even though Gould's essay style was much different, more American).<br/><br/>The later essays are more personal, focusing on disease, a few good tips on being in a hospital, (from which I loved this quote:<br/><br/><blockquote><br/>It is a rightly humiliating thought that, in spite of Man's ability to reach the moon, etc., etc., [sic], no one has yet designed a bedpan which is not physiologically inept, uncomfortable, and somewhat obscene.<br/></blockquote><br/><br/>Absolute truth - if you've ever been in a hospital and not allowed to get up, the design of any of these things hasn't changed in more than 50 years! Here's something for your ""disrupting start up""), and on religion. These are usually short, but playful, I'd read these on their own.<br/><br/>Recommended for: Fans of scientific essays, philosophy of science pre-Feyerabend",,,,,,0,,,,,

To her, the Greeks were the first to bring ""light"" into the darkness of a world ruled by darkness and magic, in the form of rational thought. The Greeks were the first to play - she compares them to the Egyptians, to whom life was just suffering. Their statues, their architecture, their poetry and writing was reduced down to the barest possible; if you've said it as precise as possible, then that's enough, no need for repetition or fancy allusions. A few playwrights are given their own chapters, in which they are compared to their ""modern"" partner (if one exists). <br/><br/>To Hamilton, Greeks were the first and the last to be truly in love with knowledge and all possible viewpoints - she gives the example that there were plays making fun of their own side during the war, which received rave reviews and full theaters. Can you imagine the same thing happen in the US nowadays [1]? Of course, it feels like sometimes her image of Greece is <i>too positive</i>, and the darker times of Athens' hubris and fall are often quickly glossed over. Then again, why focus on the ugly when you're writing a love letter?<br/><br/>Recommended for those people who'd like to know why many still see Greek philosophy, thinking and art as important.<br/><br/>[1] Her example is from WW1. But I switched for a modern example (the proof is easier to find: <a href=""http://www.alternet.org/tea-party-and-right/cut-her-head-shocking-death-threats-you-can-receive-mocking-eastwoods-american"">cough, cough</a>). Of course that comparison is unfair - Athens was small and (relatively) homogeneous in thought, the US is a huge country full of different cultures and diametrically opposed political streams.",,,,,,0,,,,,

It's heavily implied that in a world with miracles science is impossible, which again implies that there's a forced dichotomy between both; in reality, back when people still believed in miracles, they had science too! Like someone in the novel, you don't kill yourself because your models stopped working (in reality, they always stop working anyway)<br/>- The many small polite bits of Chinese have been translated word-for-word into English; and in English, they just don't fit, they make for awkward conversations once you forget that this is Chinese<br/><br/>All in all, I'd recommend it to fans of SF who'd like to see their genre from a different angle",,,,,,0,,,,,

Each chapter summarises the life of a mathematician (sometimes two, if their lives are intertwined), with about a quarter of each chapter being reserved for details on one or two discoveries.<br/><br/>In tone it reminded be a lot of Russell's History of Western Philosophy - there's the British humor and the strong opinions, some people may be put off by this. It's definitely no unbiased retelling of the history of mathematics (furthermore, about 80 years have passed. Many of these stories may turned out to have been falsehoods by now [and in looking up this book, many of them are, but that doesn't detract from their <i>fun</i>]).<br/>Some quotes to show the humor:<br/><br/><blockquote><br/>As a matter of temperament some find the Laplacian conception of an eternally stable solar system repeating the complicated cycle of its motions time after time for ever and ever as depressing as an endless nightmare.

If ever a more idiotic prescription was handed out by a doctor to a patient whose complaint he could not diagnose it has yet to be exhumed.<br/></blockquote><br/><br/>Some things I learned:<br/><br/>- many famous mathematicians were ridiculous child prodigies in their youngest ages, Gauss being the most famous example, discovering formulas at the age of 9, finishing <i>Disquisitiones Arithmeticae</i> at the age of 21 (!!!) in Latin (!!!); William Rowan Hamilton spoke 13 languages by the time he was 13 years old (E. T. Bell gets very angry about this ""waste of time"", he could have been doing mathematics!). It may make you look at your own life with a <i>hint</i> of having already wasted it.<br/><br/>- others did terrible in traditional systems - like Poincaré, who nearly failed the mathematical parts of his Bachelor's degree and was only admitted because of his previous mathematical importance<br/><br/>- funding of science changed a lot with the French revolution - before that, good mathematicians got their money from benevolent rulers, after that, they either had to give lessons or were (sometimes poorly) employed by universities<br/><br/>- transfinite numbers are weird<br/><br/>- and much more, it's a long book<br/><br/>The biggest drawback, and here the book shows its age, is the <i>very</i> dry style of the mathematical parts, maybe I'm too spoiled by pop-science writing, maybe it's the age. Sometimes, the mathematics is rather simple and you wonder why the author takes so much time to expand on these points (the age?), sometimes it's so short that you have to go look it up on Wikipedia. These definitely take their time if you want to read them properly.<br/><br/>But then again, to quote the author (on a different occasion):<br/><br/><blockquote><br/>The choice of such phraseology is not merely stereotyped pedantry. There is a reason for its use, and careful writers mean exactly what they say when they assert that “we can find, etc” <i>They mean that they can do what they say</i>.<br/></blockquote><br/><br/>Recommended for: People into mathematics; people who think a book about mathematics is boring (you may want to skip or skim the mathematical parts, but it's your loss); fans of British humor<br/><br/>Not recommended for: People without patience, as it took me a few weeks to read this; People who need the truth and nothing but the boring truth",,,,,,0,,,,,

The Trojan War goes through the Iliad (and later, a few other sources), treats the sack of Troy as if it was a historic event (including characters - they probably did not have these names, but similar people probably did exist - ""Whether Helen’s face launched a thousand ships or none, queens of the Bronze Age wielded great power and kings made war over marriage alliances.""), and then goes from event to event - could this have happened this way? Do we have evidence for similar events around that time? Do we have archaeological evidence for similar wars happening at Troy?<br/><br/>An example:<br/><br/><blockquote><br/>When the Greeks sacked the city, they  put Troy to the torch. Archaeology discloses that a savage fire destroyed the settlement level known as Troy VIi (formerly called Troy VIIa). [...] The inferno can be dated, according to the best estimate, sometime between 1230 and 1180 B.C., more likely between 1210 and 1180.<br/></blockquote><br/><br/>or<br/><br/><blockquote><br/>Bronze Age documents show that however brutal the sack of Troy may have been, it would have conformed to the laws of war. Cities that did not surrender would, if they were captured, be destroyed. This rule goes as far back as the first well-documented interstate conflict, the border wars between the two Sumerian city-states of Lagash and Umma between 2500 and 2350 B.C.<br/></blockquote><br/><br/>All the while Strauss is a great narrator - often starting out with ""Now  imagine the scene"", going into living detail how it could have been, then switching over to the primary text with comparison of secondary sources.<br/><br/>The Trojan War is a good introduction to the Iliad and its events, it doesn't purport itself to be an academic work, in fact, the introduction explains most basic archaeology.

As such, the community has developed into an almost religious cult-like thing around the ""start-up life"": ""why don't you work 22 hours a day, why don't you sleep under your desk, you have to pivot/disrupt/boot-strap/pitch/iterate/, why don't you follow our hero Zuckerberg/pg/Thiel, you have to become great <i>now</i>"" and more boring platitudes. The religious nature comes out in often-used terms like ""angel investor"" ( = someone who wastes their rich parents' money on an overvalued team, i.e., fantasy football with programmers).<br/><br/>Often a extreme fear of death comes out in these interviews and texts, now culminating in money not being focused on useless mobile apps, but on medical companies that treat death as a disease in the hopes of reversing or postponing your eventual demise (see for example <a href=""http://www.businessinsider.com.au/ellison-thiel-also-trying-to-cure-death-2013-9?op=1"">here</a>).<br/><br/>This is where The Denial of Death comes in. Becker summarizes Otto Rank's life work into a straightforward chain of argument, which goes a little bit like this: <br/><br/>1. Man has a natural urge to heroism, someone who needs to justify their own existence as an object of value - this is due to his ""evolutionary and organismic constitution"" (nice hand-waving there).<br/><br/>2. Man is also the only animal that knows he is nothing but ""food for worms"", one slip in the shower and you're done for.<br/><br/>3. This creates an inner conflict as you have the ""God-like"" inner heroism and the outer shell of a sickly creature, and both these points collide in your existence.<br/><br/>4. The job of a child is to come to terms with this conflict by more or less learning to repress, and all adults have more or less repressed this conflict. This repression is in everyone, is healthy and expected. Only when you can't handle the repression or when it becomes too extreme do you run into problems with your existence - Becker/Rank discuss this with the example of artists and ""great"", but problematic men like Freud.<br/><br/>5. Along with the fear of death comes the fear of ""too much life"", when you know so much about your condition that it becomes too hard to bear:<br/><br/><blockquote><br/>Once you accept the truly desperate situation that man is in, you come to see not only that neurosis is normal, but that even psychotic failure represents only a little additional push in the routine stumbling along life's way. If repression makes an untenable life liveable, self-knowledge can entirely destroy it for some people.</blockquote><br/><br/>6. Can we escape this dilemma? No. One solution to handle it better is to become a Kierkegaard-ian ""knight of faith"", someone who has given the meaning of his/her life over to the creator (whoever/whatever that may be), someone who accepts death and life by becoming part of a bigger system. Unlike the ""gurus"" of psychotherapy, of religion etc. (there's a nice, negative discussion of the overlap of 70s psychotherapy and religious movements), there is nothing you can do to fix or to transcend the conflict in your existence. ""Men are doomed to live in an overwhelmingly tragic and demonic world.""<br/><br/>He does make a fun case that Christianity (the idealized Christianity, not the power-structure with its own mountain of problems) has found a nice way to ""sidestep"" these problems:<br/><br/><blockquote><br/>This is the most remarkable achievement of the Christian world picture: that it could take slaves, cripples, imbeciles, the simple and the mighty, and make them all secure heroes, simply by taking a step back from the world into another dimension of things, the dimension called heaven. Or we might better say that Christianity took creature consciousness - the thing man most wanted to deny - and made it the very <i>condition</i> for his cosmic heroism.</blockquote><br/><br/>All of these arguments are straight out of the tradition of psycho-analysis; lots of interpretation, little supporting data. When Becker/Rank try to ""update"" Freud's ideas on transference by saying it's not the oedipal conflict of the child, but the fear of either death or of too much living, then you can't help but wonder if they're just trying to replace ""unprovable, logically sounding chain of arguments nr. 1"" with ""unprovable, logically sounding chain of arguments nr. 2"".<br/><br/>The problems of pure interpretation become apparent in the last chapter when Becker tries to apply the above points on many mental diseases, and here scientific knowledge has long surpassed his points, and he (as he acknowledges) extremely oversimplifies. He says that depression is ""just"" a inability to cope with their fear of life and death, but by now we know that depression is caused by a whole spectrum of causes, from genetic predisposition, prolonged substance abuse, broken neuro-transmitters, vulnerability factors, social isolation etc. pp. Please, don't go up to people with mental illness and try to explain their illness with these 40 years old ideas.<br/><br/>My above points on ""start up culture"" can be interpreted from this chain of arguments - you have people who are aware of their death, but instead of repressing it or becoming part of something bigger than them, they fight death, something that's (according to Becker/Rank) not fight-able. Their example: If you live to 900 years instead of 90, then each accident becomes so much more grave, the fear of life becomes more extreme. Let's say you're supposed to die at 900, but you have a car accident and die at 80 - that means you ""lost"" 820 years. If you're supposed to die at 90 and you die at 80, you've lost ""only"" 10 years. What will happen is that people will worship security too much as each accident's impact will become extreme.<br/><br/>Bonus-quote:<br/><br/><blockquote><br/>Creation is a nightmare spectacular taking place on a planet that has been soaked for hundreds of millions of years in the blood of all its creatures. The soberest conclusion that we could make about what has actually been taking place on the planet for about three billion years is that it is being turned into a vast pit of fertilizer. But the sun distracts our attention, always baking the blood dry, making things grow over it, and with its warmth giving the hope that comes with the organism's comfort and expansiveness.<br/></blockquote><br/><br/>Recommended for: People who like to think about their lives.<br/><br/>Not recommended for: People who can't read critically, or who immediately model their lives after everything they read. These ideas are fun to entertain, but it would be unwise to immediately accept them.",,,,,,0,,,,,

Some classic horror stories ranging from (to me) absolutely unknown Belgian or Nigerian authors, to well-known ""classics"" like Borges, Akatagawa, Kafka, and a few modern writers like Miéville, King (of course), Barron, etc.<br/><br/>Some of the stories work well as Twilight Zone, X-Files or Outer Limits episodes, and several have become episodes, but these are usually forgettable (who knew that Outer Limits episode with the scientist raising spacebugs that build a statue of the scientist's face was based on a George R. R. Martin story?).<br/><br/>My favorite stories and novellas in this are the dream-like ones, that put a rug under you and take you into someone's dream, you're not sure whether it's a nice dream of a nightmare, and just when you're getting used to it the story slips the rug from underneath you by simply ending.<br/><br/>Two novellas are worthy seeking out on their own: ""Tainaron: Mail From Another City"" by Leena Krohn, a novella in letters from a person (?) who has moved to some kind of city (or giant organism) inhabited by insect-like people, or people turning into insects (?) and writes letters to her home.<br/>""The Other Side Of The Mountain"" by Michel Bernanos is a story of a shipwreck into a different dimension (maybe) in which the world changes all of its new inhabitants physically.<br/><br/>Recommended for: Fans of something different?",,,,,,0,,,,,

Some things that struck me particularly:<br/><br/>1. Since it's set in Victorian England, communication between towns and cities is very poor, especially in the beginning of the invasion, when the next village doesn't know that their neighbors are all dead. That made me think of what would happen today with instant communication around the world.<br/><br/>2. The protagonist is no hero, he's just there as a pure witness. Most current stories focus on the ""one hero who saves the day"", this protagonist is more a bit of a coward (he could have saved the annoying priest, for example).<br/><br/>3. The heatrays used by the aliens are invisible, something which a modern writer would never write! Modern SF requires rays to be visible, even if they can't be in reality. It just has been ingrained in our collective imagination. Other examples of this are gun-silencers that are completely silent, flashbangs that don't burn, sound in space, etc.<br/><br/>4. There are a few things illogical - the ending (or solution) is rather weird, and in its abruptness reminded me a lot of the ending of the movie Signs. <spoiler>You'd think they would have worn closed suits to survive earth's viruses - and how does human blood as their food work? You probably can't survive on alien meat, except if you share common ancestors, which is highly unlikely with Mars</spoiler> Furthermore, aliens seem to favor the UK for some reason (a tradition that has been happily continued in Dr. Who), but that could be just due to the little overview of the protagonist.<br/><br/>Anyway, nice proto-SF, good to see where the genre comes from.",,,,,,0,,,,,

He explains it for metabolic networks, for protein interaction networks, and more.<br/><br/>He uses the image of Borges' Library of Babel, except that each book is a station in the library of all possible connected protein interaction networks (most of them make no sense, some of them do), and these books are connected by single changes. Each reader is an individual of a population, and if you take the wrong step (mutation) and get a book without sense, you die.<br/><br/>The interesting thing is that if you map these libraries for the organisms where there's data like <i>E. coli</i> or yeast, you can take random walks through there using programs. And what they found is that you can take very long walks (up to 80% of the library) through the library, ending up in very different networks that still produce the same outcome. That way, a large part of the library, and with that a large part of variation, is explored! Interestingly, you can do the same with human-created logical circuits, and you get very, very similar results. <br/><br/>For biologists reading this book especially the beginning might be slow as he uses many examples from undergrad biology like the lac-operon, Hox genes, and more. You might want to check out his publications instead: http://www.ieu.uzh.ch/wagner/publications.html<br/><br/>Especially ""140. Wagner, A.

"" looks good, Figure 13.2 is also in the book. Nice of him to provide reprints for most of his work!<br/><br/>Does this book solve the question of how nature comes up with innovations? It certainly is a great ""viewpoint"" and deserves more thought (from me, too).<br/><br/>Recommended for: Those interested in life who like to see things from a different angle.<br/><br/>P.S.: Looking around a bit for more reviews on the web, it seems there's a quite large group of people who are outraged by Wagner's few quips about creationists.

The later parts are a few collected poems of Herzog, an autobiographical fragment of traveling through Germany, and a few essays on Herzog.<br/><br/>The dialogue goes through Herzog's entire life and work up until ~2013, focusing mostly on his movies, especially his philosophy of his work. What impressed me most about this is how much Herzog is on fire for his work, he never compromises anything, with a certain pride to commit crimes in order to make his movies possible (forging documents, stealing cameras, a few break-ins, planned murders (understandable with Kinsi) etc.). I wish I would burn just half as much as that man.<br/><br/>The dialogue is full of great quotes on the theme Herzog vs. The World full of humor and warmth, here two examples:<br/><br/><blockquote><br/>Parents these days even send their children to the sandpit with a helmet. The whole thing is repulsive. I would never trust in a man who has had multiple helmets by the age of five.<br/></blockquote><br/><br/>or<br/><br/><blockquote><br/>You would get me watching WrestleMania before you could drag me into a theatre. I'm much more comfortable with the vulgarity of that crowd. There is more honesty in WrestleMania's fakery than in traditional theatre.<br/></blockquote><br/><br/>or on one of Herzog's common themes, mankind's relationship with the indifferent universe:<br/><br/><blockquote><br/>The overwhelming quality of the universe is monumental indifference and lack of order. It's a statistical improbability we're even on the plant, this miniscule speck surrounded by a myriad of uninhabitable, hostile and lethal stars that boil in nuclear rage. Look at the solar system from a satellite and see how utterly insignificant Earth looks. The universe couldn't care less about us, and I hope I never have to call upon it for asssistance. <br/></blockquote><br/><br/>The dialogue is filled to the brim with amazing anecdotes, some of which you may have heard already (the shoe-eating, the many quarrels with Klaus Kinski including that one time the local Natives offered to murder Kinski, all the crimes committed to get the movie done...), highly recommended. If you're not a fan of Herzog's movies or you haven't seen them, I'm pretty sure some parts will drag as you won't really know what he's talking about.<br/><br/>Recommended for: Those interested in impressive people, fans of Herzog,<br/><br/>Not recommended for: tax officials",,,,,,0,,,,,

On most pages random bystanders die.<br/><br/>The first one, Ambient, was a bit too much over the top for me (for example, ""board room meetings"" are matches to the death by a companies' champion against the other companies' champions, and the losing company has its CEO's head cut off while the companies' ownership is being transferred to the winner). This third one, Hearthen, is a bit less extreme because it acts as a bit of a prequel - it's set before Dryco became the company running the USA, with some events of the first book (such as the AI, or Ambient's ""big bad guy"") being nicely foreshadowed. Therefore, most events described aren't that extreme as in the first one (but the great Ambients don't feature as much as in the first one).<br/><br/>The basic story is that Dryco is looking for a messiah so it can use him for their company PR, finds one who performs Jesus-like miracles and tries to hire him, he mostly goes along with it (without any real motivation except ""my God(s) told me to""), there's a relatively believable ""good"" female main character, yet the story often just bungles around without really progressing. I guess it's good as a part of the series but doesn't work on its own, yet I liked the ""less extreme""/""more quiet"" aspects of it.<br/><br/>[1] IT HAD A TURBO BUTTON to slow down to 16 Mhz (else Theme Park would run too fast)",,,,,,0,,,,,

While he's on the way to meet a former female colleague he realises that he has been more than blind towards her interest... It's hard to describe how well Ishiguro <i>understates</i> his reactions to her, and it's up to the reader to realise what's going on. It reminded me of (and if you're a man, it will remind you too) of dialogues in your youth like this one:<br/><br/>Her: Sooo (short pause, finger in hair and a twirl) what are you doing this weekend?<br/>You: Hmm not much. Maybe TV?<br/>Her: I don't have much planned either!<br/>You: Huh. Well, um, enjoy, I have to go now.<br/><br/>[exeunt you and your idiocy]<br/><br/>And then 10 years later this memory suddenly hits you out of nowhere and you <i>still</i> have to groan.<br/><br/>Anyway, the book is much more than that - there is some hilarity ensuing from too much Britishness (the 23-year old godson of the manor's lord is to marry soon - the father himself never explained ""the birds and the bees"", and is too shy to do it. He asks the godfather, who then turns out to be too shy, too, and the godfather asks the butler in a hilariously awkward scene, who does his best to try and bring up that particular topic of discussion), there is much about Britain's appeasement politics in the 20s and 30s, and you can't help but marvel how well this all is constructed.<br/><br/>The first quarter or so is dry (lots of ""philosophy of butlering"") but it sets up the character - so if you're finding yourself bored, keep on working, it will be worth it in the end.",,,,,,0,,,,,

The private company sending everyone to the planet makes sense - earth-water costs $50 per bottle and is deducted from the salary, since transport is expensive. Workers are strange and remind me of ""drones"", but that is the psychological profile needed if you're stuck on another planet on your own. There is no ""evil"" in the company, just straightforward capitalism.<br/><br/>I'm currently stuck in another country waiting for a visa, while my fiancée is a 20 hour plane ride away that I can't take anyway, since there's an 8 hour time difference we communicate mostly in writing, so the book struck a totally unexpected chord with me.

Religion is my least favorite part, possibly because my interest into religion is so low.<br/> <br/>I especially like Dyson's penchant to connect seemingly unconnected fields, and how quick he starts to ""think big"" without any fear of looking ridiculous (remember the <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dyson_sphere"">Dyson sphere</a>?) - I'm a fan of the concept of using genetically modified trees to terraform the inside of asteroids.

You have to love it when the introduction already has a quote like ""Klassikerverehrung [ist] eine Spezialität des deutschen Untertanen-Staates"" (hard to translate: the worship of classic novels is a specialty of the German underling-state).<br/><br/>It starts with some ""general"" essays on German literature like on the role of Jews in German literature or the ""heart"" in German writing, and then iterates over authors, starting with Walther von der Vogelweide and ending with a review of Süskind's Das Parfum. There's a bit of a focus is on Reich-Ranicki's temporaries, post WW2 literature, GDR literature - Koeppen, Grass, Kästner, Weiss, Dürrenmatt etc., but it's not like the earlier history in the form of Goethe, Lessing, Hölderlin, Heine, Hesse etc. is neglected. (The essay on Kraus made me laugh - Reich-Ranicki didn't like Kraus' constant need to be some kind of messiah/prophet for his ""disciples"" without a hint of self-irony, no wonder Franzen loves Kraus so much! They're the same person!) <br/><br/>There's so much previously unknown (to me) to discover here (Alfred Polgar, Eva Demski, Jureck Becker, Ulla Hahn, Ingeborg Bachmann, Sarah Kirsch, Erich Fried...), and for that I'm thankful. All essays and reviews are honest - bad writing is dragged to the light, nonsensical formulations by greats like Schiller are logically analyzed and ripped apart, love letters are written to good writing (and sometimes, like in Jelinek's essay, even bad writing is praised if the power behind becomes obvious).<br/><br/>It's a good, but not really coherent intro to German literature with a slight focus on the modern.

Godine,Paperback,198,2005,1940,2014/09/06,2014/09/04,italy,italy (#2),read,"Once, I spent a summer working in a wine bottling factory in my hometown in Germany. My job was to stand next to a machine which filled plastic bags with cheap, mixed white wine, and a conveyor belt put these bags into boxes. Australians call these bags affectionately ""goon bags"". My task was to put the filled boxes on pallets.<br/> <br/>I worked with a man about 30 years my senior - he had worked in that factory for more than 20 years, the last 10 years on that machine. With my 19 years, in a state that constantly seeks the new, that man was my nightmare personified, and I could not understand how he could stand this life. <br/>My perception of his life as a nightmare wasn't improved by the fact that his first action, every morning, was to take the first filled goon bag. He drank one bag per shift. I once asked him half-jokingly what his future plans were - he answered: ""I have only 15 years to go, then I can retire!"" That answer gave me a minor panic attack. <br/><br/>I soon lived in his world: I don't know if you've ever worked in a factory, but once you're fully in a mindless repetitive task, time ceases to exist. After 2 weeks of work, 8 hour shifts were over in seconds, and at home I was too tired to stop the flow of seconds. A month of this work felt like 3 minutes, and I could understand how the man could treat 15 years so flippantly; to him, 15 years are half an hour.<br/><br/>This book transported me right back into that mindset: ""I still have time"", the lie based on the vague hope that something might happen to you, while the days are just slipping away. The K.-like passivity I so easily fall into, based on the lie that things happen to me, I don't have to make them happen. This book gave me a minor panic attack.<br/><br/>Recommended for: People who think there's still time, this book is a warning.",,,,,,0,,,,,

And it's not like he's evading the war - if he doesn't lie in his recollections, then he's at the forefront of every battle, always overtaking his own people. He makes Die Hard movies look plausible.<br/><br/>Two really weird aspects about the book:<br/><br/>1) He is a huge fan of wartime heroism - he doesn't care for why or what he fights, as long as he can prove his ""Ritterlichkeit"", his chivalry. If he dies, so be it; it would be an honour to die on the battle-field (one is reminded of Mishima). In fact lots of people in this book die for absolutely nothing (one example are his ""boys"", the lower ranks who have to do his minor tasks for him - several of them die getting his food).<br/><br/>2) (This one might be lost in translation if you don't read the German original) He often uses the language of sports to describe the war, which feels rather strange when he talks about his friends being blown up in the words that I know only from tennis. Storming the enemy's trenches is a ""short, sports-like sensation"" - injured soldiers are ""ausgeschieden"" (eliminated? but that word is used in death,too) , which nowadays is only used for sportsmen who're forced to leave the competition due to external circumstances  - he's injured during a huge battle, yet he's sad about leaving the battlefield in this ""interesting moment"". <br/><br/>Maybe this is a product from the fact that he doesn't shy back from his own monstrosity - there are several scenes in the book in which he's just a twitch away from executing unarmed enemies; he often shoots fleeing soldiers in the back. A modern Iraq veteran writing about his war like this would be branded a psychopath (yet he might not be lying).<br/><br/>The <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ernst_J%C3%BCnger"">Jünger Wikipedia article</a> makes for good reading, too - he was against National Socialism to the point that he had connections to the Stauffenberg bomb plot. Only his famous <i>In Stahlgewittern</i> and his extremely high-level merits saved him from being executed. Interestingly, he later experimented with many drugs and became a good friend of Albert Hofmann, the discoverer of LSD. It's the last thing I expected from a far-right conservative war hero.<br/><br/>Recommended for: <br/>Those interested in history or war, this year's centennial is a good chance to read this.<br/><br/>Not recommended for: The squeamish, there's blood, brains and severed body pieces on practically every page.",,,,,,0,,,,,

I've already got a bit of a career in science, I don't need chapters telling me how a theory is formed. The various facts about different ant colonies are quite inspiring, though.<br/><br/>One note: It's often said that Wilson doesn't like maths and tells other people they don't need it, but here the position is a bit better fleshed out, and more agreeable: <br/>1) he only talks about algebra as used for model building and in theoretical biology, he never mentions statistics at all (which you'll need, dear student).<br/>2) he correctly says that the time investment into learning all the maths is better invested elsewhere if you got diverging interests - you can always find a collaborator who's better at mathematics than you are. The last two chapters, in which Wilson describes how theories are developed and tested using stories from his life, show that; he always lists collaborators who built the models based on his data.<br/>In the end, it seems he says 'you don't need maths' as a bit of 'propaganda', since there are prospective scientists who end up in different careers out of a fear of mathematics.<br/><br/>Recommended for: High school students/undergrads who are looking for something to do with their lives",,,,,,0,,,,,

Starting around 1890 and ending in 1939, this is something of a memoir of Stefan Zweig, one of the most famous German-language Austrian writers of the early 20th century. But it's less about Zweig himself than about the <i>artistic world</i> of Vienna and Paris before the first world war. Both had a brimming high culture that, if Zweig doesn't call on too much hyperbole, I haven't encountered once in my life. Both cultures never seem to have recovered from both world wars - I've been to Vienna and was greeted by arrogance; I've been to Paris and was greeted by the smell of asparagus (rs4481887 (A;A) says hello). Maybe it takes a few hundred years more?<br/><br/>Several times the book surprised me - did you know that before 1914, you didn't need a passport for anything? Zweig travelled to the US and to India without one; and, to kill some time, found 5 different jobs open to anyone; no-one had visa or passports back then, it wasn't needed. I also didn't know that Austrian women around 1900 lived extremely strict lives; no woman was allowed to know about her sexuality, it was the husband's job during the wedding night to, um, give a crash-course. (Interesting sidenote: Zweig firmly believed that prostitution went down after these strict rules disappeared. I'm skeptical.)<br/><br/>I was also surprised to learn in what an environment Zweig grew up in: his circle of adolescent friends all started to publish in literary magazines around 17, 18 years old - all of them constantly writing and bouncing ideas off each other, meeting with such famous writers as Hoffmansthal and more. In fact it's amazing what famous names show up in this book, many names of the greatest artists appear. Some of those were Zweig's friends, some of them colleagues, all of them described in several scenes: Theodor Herzl, Rudolf Steiner, Romain Rolland (he was of particular importance to Zweig and appears often), Rilke (especially fun descriptions of him - somehow comically inept at life), Yeats, Gorky, Walter Rathenau (!!), Karl Haushofer, Emile Verhaeren, Ignaz Seipel, James Joyce, H.G. Wells, and many many more.<br/><br/>Surprising too that Zweig, after he enrolled in university, immediately took three years off. You can't do that anymore - universities have lost their role of creating ""citizens"", now universities are concerned with churning out <i>Humankapital</i> in the duty of neoliberalism and capitalism (I'm just jealous). It's also fun to know that the <i>Burschenschaften</i> and <i>Verbindungen</i> back then were the same idiotic far-right weirdos they are now (except that nowadays, most of them stopped fencing with ""real"" weapons - the visible facial scar has disappeared from Germany's intelligentsia).<br/><br/>Zweig saw himself as a citizen of the world first, and much of this book is concerned with the European project and the slow death of the ""Weltgewissen"" (the world's conscience). The parts in which both world wars start are heart-breaking, and the strongest of the book; Zweig sees the suffering, and suffers himself. He knew that we as human can only get past the violence if we unite. Maybe now my generation has a chance again - humans from all countries are connected to each other, in fact, I'd wager that most of my friends grew up in the Internet first and in their country second.<br/><br/>Recommended for: People who see themselves as citizens of the world. European politicians. ",,,,,,0,,,,,

Darwin had many scientific friends who fought his public wars for him, Thomas Huxley being at the front. I have to read a biography on Huxley, ""Darwin's bulldog"", next - luckily Adrian Desmond wrote on, too.<br/><br/>- Ideas never stand alone in a vacuum. I knew before this book that Darwin's theories on natural selection are based on the already known concept of evolution, on Malthus and Lyell. This book does a great job of exhibiting all minor and major influences on Darwin's thinking.<br/><br/>- Something I heard for the first time in this book is how precarious Darwin's health was. Psychosomatic? Crohn's disease? The book never explains it, but after every minor period of stress, Darwin either vomited or had to retreat to his bed for a week. He rarely held public speeches, preferring letters. Bad reviews could send him to bed for weeks. (On writing this I checked Google - <a href=""http://rsnr.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/61/1/23.full"">at least one publication says he had Crohn's disease</a>)<br/><br/>- Back then, people had their children late in life - I remember at least one couple in the book where the mother gives birth to her first child at 38. Darwin's wife Emma gave birth to their last, tenth child at the age of 48. People say that ""older"" mothers are a recent trend, doesn't seem to be the case?<br/><br/>- Darwin pioneered a few approaches for which we have fancy buzzwords now. He tracked most of the things he did, including all scores of all Backgammon games against his wife, his health - we call that Quantified Self now. On scientific questions, he tracked and kept all minor details about his work - sending out questionnaires to all parties that could possibly have anything to do with the question, which before him wasn't that common.<br/><br/>- Science 150 years ago had a completely different model of funding. Darwin himself was mostly funded by his father, the Voyage of the Beagle was completely paid for by Dr. Darwin. Later on, Darwin's money came from farms his father bought him, living the Dickensian dream. At the beginning of Darwin's career, science was mostly done by ""unemployed gentlemen scholars"" (of which there is <a href=""http://robertedgar.wordpress.com/2010/05/04/an-unemployed-gentleman-scholar/"">nowadays only one</a>), but the employment model changed during his life towards what we have now, mostly government-funded.<br/><br/>- Since the majority of this book is based on letters, I wonder how biographies of the future will work. Nowadays it's all emails, most of them in password-protected data vaults that will disappear when the hosting company (inevitably) disappears. I'd like to read scientific journals of historians a hundred years in the future - with publications such as ""How to restore e-mails from the early 21st century email client, Mozilla Thunderbird"".<br/><br/>- Like many successful people, Darwin (for the longest time) didn't know what he wanted to do with his life. He had a Pokemon-like obsession with collecting bugs, the Voyage of the Beagle only happened because of luck. Reassuring if you're, like me, one of those people who for the longest time just drifted along in life.<br/><br/>- Huxley coined ""agnostic"" when he got annoyed that opponents of natural selection always tried to drag the debate onto religious grounds. Haeckel (nowadays mostly known for his beautiful naturalistic paintings) coined many terms we use today in biology - ""phylum"", ""phylogeny"", and many more. The story of Haeckel, with his broken English, meeting Darwin, with his barely existing German, is one of the cutest stories in the book.<br/><br/>Not recommended for: People who want their history cut-and-dry; this book belongs to narrative history, often describing things which the author could have no way of knowing.<br/><br/>Recommended for: People who like to trace the development of ideas. Fans of the history of biology. ",,,,,,0,,,,,

Then there's the new 'Bazaar', in which rapid development around a core team of developers is favoured, developers who are constantly in contact with users and co-developers - most of open source software development happens like this.<br/><br/>It's an interesting time-document that directly led to the founding of what's now known as Mozilla, but it's also outdated. Reading the arguments I couldn't help but constantly think 'but what about Heartbleed?' for most points - for those few who haven't heard of it, Heartbleed is/was a huge security bug in the widely used openSSL library that enabled attackers to read arbitrary memory of any SSL-enabled webserver.<br/><br/>Especially towards the end the book builds up a few straw-men to take down, and then it gets annoying - like when the book says that 'Bazaar' style development doesn't need the business (Cathedral) world's top-down style management, because open source is just so much <i>fun</i> that it doesn't need managers! 'But what about heartbleed?': the OpenSSL code is such a notorious mess that for years developers who wanted to fix any problems recoiled as if encountering a Lovecraftian horror, quickly abandoning their good intentions to save their sanity. The argument of 'many shallow eyes see all important bugs' obviously didn't pan out, the bug existed for years.<br/><br/>Only now are some openBSD people working on fixing OpenSSL in LibreSSL, but for them it's a concerted effort with 'management' involved, so it seems to be some kind of chimera between Bazaar and Cathedral, in which only very few 'outsiders' are involved.<br/><br/>I guess Bazaar style development doesn't work that well for security relevant software; it's insanely complicated and there are too many 'bad' agents (like the NSA) who can act as good 'customers of the Bazaar'. <br/><br/>But it still goes some good points here and there, like for example this one:<br/><br/><blockquote><br/>Treating your users as co-developers is your least-hassle route to rapid code improvement and effective debugging.<br/></blockquote><br/><br/>It's a quick read, I'd recommend it to all open source programmers interested into seeing where their hobby comes from.<br/><br/>UPDATE 30.12.2014: I just found <a href=""http://queue.acm.org/detail.cfm?id=2349257&ref=fullrss"">this longer good essay</a> revisiting the main points of the book, quote:<br/><br/><blockquote><br/>That is the sorry reality of the bazaar Raymond praised in his book: a pile of old festering hacks, endlessly copied and pasted by a clueless generation of IT ""professionals"" who wouldn't recognize sound IT architecture if you hit them over the head with it. It is hard to believe today, but under this embarrassing mess lies the ruins of the beautiful cathedral of Unix, deservedly famous for its simplicity of design, its economy of features, and its elegance of execution.

The original title, which roughly translates to ""The age of the Asakusa gamblers"", fits best (and in this case, the word for gamblers is <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bakuto"">Bakuto</a>). The main character of the book <i>is</i> a Yakuza, but not the kind you associate with it today - their only trade is illegal gambling, the kind of gambling you might know from Samurai period movies. You know: three guys sitting at a table, the guy in the middle half-naked who's job it is to throw the dice, everybody shouting 'Odds!' or 'Even!' to bet on the outcome, the other two guys collecting or handing out money, that's it.<br/><br/>There are a couple of wonderful scenes - for example, at one point the Yakuza are told by the police to hand in all of their guns or they would be shut down. Since guns were practically impossible to get, they didn't have any, but in order to escape persecution they had to move heaven and earth to find some. In the end, they bought three guns, each at the price of a <i>house</i>, so they could hand those in to the police.<br/><br/>It's not particularly well-written (translated?), and the story stays a bit unfocused, but it's quite interesting.",,,,,,0,,,,,

Without his stupid and unnecessary lies in the 50s, the entire FBI communist scare theatre in which  he lost his security clearance wouldn't have happened this way. His earlier physics papers had quite a few mathematical errors, but he did predict the existence of positrons and of black holes.<br/><br/>This book is full of small, beautiful details and inspiring stories, too many to quote here. I only have '18246 characters left'.<br/><br/>Recommended for: Fans of everything.<br/><br/>Not recommended for: People who need to see thoughts laid out in linear time. When describing the development of physical theories, Monk has a habit of jumping into the future, as in: 'The first clue towards this new particle was #{something} (20 years later, it was revealed that this particle was actually two particles). The second clue was #{something else}.' It's a bit like Holmes describing the first clue, then revealing who the murder was, and then revealing the second clue.<br/><br/>P.S.: Who knew that after relativity, Einstein's contributions to physics were less than minor for more than 30 years?<br/><br/>P.P.S.: Two quotes of Oppenheimer that are very important today.<br/><br/>On secrecy around the atomic bombs:<br/><br/><blockquote><br/>There is grave danger for us that these decisions have been taken on the basis of facts held secret. This is not because the men who must contribute to the decisions, or must make them, are lacking in wisdom; it is because wisdom itself cannot flourish, nor even truth be determined, without the give and take of debate and criticism. The relevant facts could be of little use to an enemy,yet they are indispensable for an understanding of questions of policy.<br/></blockquote><br/><br/>On knowing yourself:<br/><br/><blockquote><br/>It is the knowledge of the inwardness of evil, and an awareness that in our dealings with this we are very close to the center of life. It is true of us as a people that we tend to see all devils as foreigners,; it is true of us ourselves, most of us, who are not artists, that in our public life, and to a distressing extent our private life as well, we reflect and project and externalize what we cannot bear to see within us. When we are blind to the evil in ourselves, we dehumanize ourselves, and we deprive ourselves not only of our own destiny, but of any possibility of dealing with the evil in others.<br/></blockquote>",,,,,,0,,,,,

He usually starts off with a mini-biography of the essay's namesake, only then to go wherever the links take him - reading these essays feels like talking to someone who's in love with his work. 'This guy wrote some of the greatest essays ever, oh by the way if you like him there's this half-forgotten contemporary artist whose arias you should listen to, did I tell you I once met his cousin and we had the most wonderful discussion of Aristotle?' - this breathless love is how most of the essays are structured.<br/><br/>The essays are ordered alphabetically, James writes that this order is arbitrary, yet I can't help but think that it's no coincidence that the book ends with the essay on Stefan Zweig. The Austrian <i>Kaffeehaus</i>-culture of liberal humanism under the roof of the arts is one of the major themes of all essays. The destruction of the Austrian culture by the Austria's <i>Anschluß</i> (the word Anschluß appears at least 50 times) and the scattering of Paris' intellectuals during the German invasion, is heavily implied to be the worst thing to have happened to the European intellectual life in the last 100 years, and most of the essays focus on that particular group of people. It's a joy to read his takedown of Sartre, and his love for such greats as Polar, Camus, Chamfort, Croce, Kafka, Friedell,  Reich-Ranicki (as a German, that made me happy) is gigantic and jumps off the pages, infecting you. I've underlined so many books, it's going to be a minor chore to add them to my to-read shelf.<br/><br/>Luckily, James is also a funny writer:<br/><br/><blockquote><br/>Lysenko preached the kind of biological theories that Stalin could understand: i.e., they were poppycock.<br/></blockquote><br/><br/>Some of the essays are rather strange, in these, James just goes off the track too far. The essay on Sophie Scholl quickly morphs into one about Natalie Portman (and Portman gets way more pages, weirdly enough), the essay on Charlie Chaplin immediately turns into a lacklustre discussion of art vs. science (and I've read better things about that particular 'conflict'), one essay is a bit about how the 'degeneration' of English is bad: as a biologist, I firmly believe that people who hold beliefs like that would have stood on shore while the first reptile crawled on land, telling the reptile to 'stop degenerating'. The essay on Heinrich Heine is just an overlong negative rant about autograph seekers.<br/><br/>The worst essay is also the most Australian one, in which he rants for pages on pages on how the Afghani asylum seekers on board the Tampa bound to Australia in 2001 are just 'illegal immigrants' and 'queue jumpers', who should have just stayed in their home country until their application would have been accepted. It's especially worse because James, at that point, has spent 400 pages being in love with WW2-era intellectuals who've done nothing but 'jump queues' when they've escaped their home-country - can you imagine Einstein just sitting in Germany while the Gestapo is kicking down doors, waiting for his letter of invitation? Thomas Mann, too, was allowed into the USA without any papers, and Czechoslovakia even offered him citizenship so that he could formally immigrate.<br/><br/>Sometimes, his own character comes through too much, I think this is best exemplified by this sentence:<br/><br/><blockquote><br/>When filming in Rome, I had a jacket made by the celebrated tailor Littrico, and found out that I had the same measurements as Gorbachev: they were on file in Littrico's office.<br/></blockquote><br/><br/>To which I can only say: so what?<br/><br/>But these <i>Rohrkrepierer</i>-essays are in the tiny minority. I'd love to see a book like this on the life and work of scientists (if I remember correctly, only one of the 'good' essays has to do with science).<br/><br/>Recommended for: People who can't get enough stuff into their brain.<br/><br/>Not recommended for: People who, if they go on travelling to a beautiful country, get angry if there's a detour.<br/>",,,,,,0,,,,,

Her illness started in the 1970s when lithium had just started as the recommended drug (and in much higher doses than today). The interest in her mood-swings led her to start a successful career as a psychiatrist, which greatly benefits this book - she's able to write objectively about her massive mood-swings, her suicide attempt, the genetic basis of her illness and the stages of her illness (it's a huge difference from Mark Vonnegut's [b:The Eden Express: A Memoir of Insanity|28134|The Eden Express  A Memoir of Insanity|Mark Vonnegut|https://d.gr-assets.com/books/1388279702s/28134.jpg|28720]).

He often comes so close to the actual truth that you want to shout at the book while reading it - I wonder what he would have done with Rosalind Franklin's X-Ray diffraction images of DNA.... <br/><br/>In other times he's a bit lost, like when he thinks that new physical laws are needed to solve the riddle of heredity; as far as I know, we didn't need to come up with new laws. I don't think that's his fault, though: he was just hypothesizing from the data available to him at that time.<br/><br/>One of the cooler concepts Schrödinger introduces is the concept of life as a system that ""eats"" entropy and thereby evades thermodynamic equilibrium, as predicted by the second law of thermodynamics.<br/><br/>The book itself is further proof that scientists never operate in an intellectual vacuum, every great discovery is based on preceeding thougts. Both Watson and Crick, the discoverers of the DNA-structure, had read the book. Without it I doubt they would have thought of the structure the way they did.<br/><br/>The second book ""Mind and Matter"" is much more philosophical in nature and concerns free will, the self and how we perceive the world. Here Schrödinger quotes Indian scripture to make his point that the subject and object are one, conciousness isn't as clear cut as people commonly believe, etc. If you're into that this part will bore you. It did, however, contain a small discussion of cultural heredity in the form of ""Mnemes"" - something which has been popularized by Dawkins in the last few decades.<br/><br/>Recommended for: Fans of science, it's so short you can read it in an afternoon. People interested in the history of science, What Is Life? is one of the most influental scientific books of the last 100 years (judging on how many scientists cite it as their prime inspiration to get into biology).",,,,,,0,,,,,

The <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nanking_Massacre"">Wikipedia article</a> has photos, it's NOT safe for lunch or work.<br/><br/>Chang wrote the book out of anger over the crime being either forgotten, or actively downplayed by the Japanese and it clearly shows in the book - there's lots of judgmental language (a ""brave crusader"" sues the Japanese government, the Chinese defended Shanghai with ""extraordinary valor"" etc.) so if you want a truly unbiased neutral account you have to read the Wikipedia article (edit: but I don't think the book distorts the facts). It's a very, very depressing book - first the history that led up to this massacre, then the massacre itself, several eyewitness accounts (including from the diary of the German John Rabe), and a bit on how the massacre is treated nowadays.<br/><br/>It's a slightly older book, some things have shifted since then - Ishihara Shintaro is quoted as a denier of the Rape of Nanking, after the publication of this book he became Governor of Tokyo (his Wikipedia article is mostly ""Other controversial statements"", like a mean version of Prince Philip) [1]. <br/><br/>I feel that in recent times, the issue of ""comfort women"" (forced prostitutes) has taken over the debate, especially since Japan finally started to pay some reparations to Korea in December 2015 (an issue that extends far beyond Korea - Chinese, Philippine, Vietnamese, Thai, Dutch, Australian etc. women were forced into prostitution, like <a href=""http://www.janbanning.com/comfort-woman-ellen-van-der-ploeg-passed-away/"">Ellen van der Ploeg</a>.) Of course there's a sizable and loud minority in Japan that asserts that these women were all voluntary prostitutes or are lying to get money from Japan.<br/><br/>Germany actually recently <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Rabe_%28film%29"">made a movie about John Rabe</a>, the ""good German of Nanking"", good reviews but it did quite poorly in terms of revenue, I guess people are tired of WW2 dramas.<br/><br/>One thing that I'd like to add, which is missing in the book, is that the conflict about Japanese war-crimes between China, Japan and Korea is still ongoing because it's a useful tool to conservatives on both sides when it comes to debated territories like the Senkaku Islands or the Liancourt Rocks (gas, oil resources). The Japanese say ""our opponents come up with these lies to gain the upper hand in this conflict, make us look bad, and force money and concessions out of us!"", and the Korean and Chinese say ""the Japanese are still lying about their crimes, how can we trust them now?"". This won't end very soon, both sides are at a stalemate. It's a bit easier for Germany to recognise its own crimes because Germany is not fighting with Poland over resources, there is nothing to lose.<br/><br/>I've been reading the recent [b:Black Earth: The Holocaust as History and Warning|23995415|Black Earth  The Holocaust as History and Warning|Timothy Snyder|https://d.gr-assets.com/books/1433433006s/23995415.jpg|43596108], and there are some good points on the destruction of the state as a prerequisite for an excess of violence which would fit very well here.<br/><br/>[1] If you're into Japanese literature this might interest you: In his younger days Ishihara was a good friend of [a:Yukio Mishima|35258|Yukio Mishima|https://d.gr-assets.com/authors/1213653898p2/35258.jpg], the guy in this <a href=""https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Ishihara_Mishima.jpg"">this famous picture of Mishima</a> is Ishihara.",,,,,,0,,,,,

Karma exists but it it's more useful for reincarnation - there is no all-encompassing ""good"" like in the Christian worldview.<br/><br/>The entire folklore of Japanese yokai is fascinating, and Hearn touches on some of them, like the Yuki-Onna, but it's often feels like Hearn influences the stories too much.<br/><br/>The last few chapters are all weird, starting with an autobiographical story of Hearn that I did not particularly care for, then continuing with a strange description of Horai, a mythical Chinese and Japanese place, but the description differs from anything else in the Japanese literature and must have been mostly invented by Hearn. Sadly, this ""taints"" the other preceding stories: I can't tell whether Hearn influenced them, or if they're ""proper"" Japanese stories. <br/><br/>Even weirder is the finishing chapter with Hearn's thoughts on butterflies, mosquitoes and ants. Interestingly he described that ants keep mushrooms, I thought that was a more recent discovery.<br/><br/>Recommended for: Fans of Japan, and those who like Folklore stories.

When Tolkien creates the world of LOTR, he gives the reader only a glimpse of what Tolkien has built - he tells you that there are a ton of different races, but in the story not all of them appear; Tolkien tells you that all of these races have complete, twisted, intertwined back-stories, but gives you only a glimpse, as much as you need to know. Butcher, on the other hand, creates only exactly as much back story as needed - there are 3 types of werewolves, ergo all of them have to appear (however ham-fisted their inclusion in the story is [1]), he tells you all there is about them (not much) and then has all the characters act out all there is to them, nothing is left to the fog...

Glover doesn't offer many solutions for the future (maybe in another book?) except that we need political restraints on a world scale (but: if you have a world police, that police can kill without problems) and we need to learn how to develop ethics and psychology in the face of technology that enables us to kill men, women, children at the press of a button.<br/><br/>A few personal takeaways:<br/><br/>- People <i>actually learn from history</i>, and they actually <i>learn from books!</i> During the Cuba Missile Crisis the Soviets cited their personal war experience and Kennedy cited the First World War, especially Tuchman's <a href='https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/11366.The_Guns_of_August'>Guns of August</a>, as reasons why they did not want to continue the conflict (as a sidenote, reading the letters and opinions of the US military leaders who wanted to keep the conflict going makes you realize how realistic Jack D. Ripper in Dr. Strangelove is)<br/><br/>- History repeats itself, all the time; when the Athenians attacked the Melians, they 'presented [their] hard amoralism as mere realism'. Everyone else has done that since, here in Australia the current government clouds their inhumanity in the guise of 'adults being in charge'.<br/><br/>- In a way, the First World War was present at Nagasaki and Hiroshima. Glover makes a nice case how the 'modern' sliding of standards in regards to the death of civilians in wartime started at the blockade of Hamburg in WW1, went on to the indiscriminate bombing of civilians from Germans and the British, and culminated in the atomic bombs. If this book would have come out later it would have included indiscriminate drone killings in the Middle East in that slide.<br/><br/>- Internet trolls with absolute horrifying opinions in the comment section of news-articles are nothing new:<br/><blockquote><br/>[...] another American massacre of Japanese survivors in lifeboats provoked a letter of moral criticism, which was published. Many of the replies to that letter claimed that Japanese atrocities justified the massacre. One reader wrote of 'killing a helpless rattlesnake'. Another had 'thoroughly enjoyed' reading about the slaughter'. Another said that a 'good old American custom I would like to see is nailing a Jap hide on every ""backhouse"" door in America'.<br/></blockquote><br/><br/>- Glover doesn't like Heidegger in the slightest: 'The inarticulate complexity is Heidegger's trademark. Can someone whose thinking is so blurred be a serious philosopher?' Or even better (you have to know that Heidegger once wrote that Hitler's hands were beautiful):<br/><br/><blockquote><br/>To imagine a meeting between them, with Heidegger glancing at Hitler's marvellous hands and talking about the unity of the outside-of-itself in the raptures of the future, is to be reminded how easily the Führer was moved to rage. That the two men did not meet is one of surrealism's great losses in the twentieth century.<br/></blockquote><br/><br/>Not recommended for: <br/>1) The squeamish. Every atrocity is introduced with several personal eyewitness accounts, it makes for good nightmare material.

Since this is reality, there is no 'red thread' going through the book - people appear, they disappear, they reappear, most of the time they die.<br/><br/>The major theme of the novel is brutality, so if you can't stomach that, stay away. In this book the Russian army has a pecking order based on sheer brutality, the new ones get beaten up by the old ones, the higher rungs beat up the lower ones, etc. - and not just a slap, but kicks in the face until teeth fall out, every night. Chechen warriors disembowel captured Russians, or publicly slit their throats. People get blown up, so that only a foot is sent home in a zinc coffin, welded shut. Mothers of missing soldiers are accidentally shot - they've come to Chechnya to find their sons, since the chaotic Russian army can't really keep track of anything. Deserters run away? Eh, so what, they'll die anyway. Newcomers steal some ammunition? The officers get drunk, beat up the newcomers brutally over days, mock-execute them, until they kick them out naked into Chechnya; left to die.<br/><br/>I can't really understand the comparison to Catch-22 in Goodreads' description - Catch-22 was an over-the-top satire which took many freedoms to get the point across, One Soldier's War is just nihilist brutality from start to end.",,,,,,0,,,,,

The outdoor propaganda is Juche Thought, a relatively inconsistent quasi-Communist waffling no-one really bothers to understand or 'fix'. The internal propaganda (called 'the Text' in the book) is interesting - a racist national set of ideas, initially copied from the Japanese under Hirohito, and then amended over the decades. <br/><br/>The Koreans are the 'purest' people, and since they're so 'pure' they need protection from the outside world from the Dear Leader, the most Korean Korean. The Koreans are a child-like race too pure, under constant threat from  outside evils such as 'Yankees', diverse 'puppet regimes' of the Yankees like the South Koreans, and other threats to their purity. It's a little bit like North Koreans see themselves like one of these overbred dogs who can't walk up stairs on his own.<br/><br/>This is all very interesting to learn, especially as the depth of Western media's reporting on the DPRK can be summarized as 'look at these weirdos lololol here's the weather' Myers seems to have strong opinions on other Western DPRK researchers, and since I know very little about North Koreans, I can't judge how accurate he is. In fact, if what this book says it's true, it's going to be much, much more difficult to change the political situation in North Korea than it was in East Germany - East Germans saw the economical success of West Germany and wanted the same which was one of the factors leading to collapse, North Korea sees the economical success of South Korea and treats it as a sign of their 'unpure' depravity. Even if the military leadership is replaced or eliminated like in Iraq, people won't be cheering - you can't just replace an entire mythology, taught over 50 years, over night and think people will accept you.<br/><br/>Sadly this book is a bit short, and was published before Kim Jong-un became leader/president/head honcho. I would've liked to read what Myers thinks of Kim Jong-un - he certainly seems to portray the 'child-like' in the North Korean mythology very well [1]. As a biologist, I would have also liked to read more about the 'scientific' side of the racist myth, since the Soviet Union had their own science (Lysenkoism) and ran experiments etc. Does that scientific side even exist?<br/><br/>Bonus fact: You can read this book pretending it's about an alien race on Venus and it still works!<br/><br/>Recommended for: People interested in authoritarian regimes, different ways to view the world, Korea, communism, and those who like to read excerpts from strange, alien novels.<br/><br/>Not recommended for: People who like to cling to their belief that North Korea is led by a bunch of bumbling fools.<br/><br/>[1] Seriously, on all official pictures he looks like a fat baby.",,,,,,0,,,,,

The book is best when the alien has just picked up a hitchhiker - it's always the nervous, broken inner monologue of the alien who fears that she may be discovered, and who dies on the inside as she knows that she'll never be able to return - then it switches over to her passenger, who in Scottish dialect tries to make sense of her (often on a sexual level). <br/><br/>Most of the time these ""non-dialogues"" are hilariously awkward, like when she tries to find a topic to small-talk in order to find out whether the police will look for the hitchhiker, while he tries to find any topic to start on.<br/><br/>Recommended for: vegetarians? <br/><br/>Not recommended for: people who can't see past the SF<br/><br/>[1] <spoiler>For the longest time, I thought there would be a twist in the end that reveals that the aliens are actually time travelers from the future since their world is so much like a classic human dystopia, but no twist.</spoiler>",,,,,,0,,,,,

Ford",,"=""""","=""""",4,3.86,Princeton University Press,Kindle Edition,269,2012,2012,2014/11/17,2014/04/06,biology,biology (#10),read,"A very interesting take on agriculture with a focus on plants and their future - the author applies Dawkin's selfish gene concept to explain and hypothesize about various concepts floating around agriculture right now. <br/>He's got three basic ideas on which the book is based on - the first is that natural selection doesn't miss easy ror tradeoff-free improvements; in these chapters there's disappointment in the promises of GM-advocates, as the ""low hanging fruits"" of plant improvement may not exist. I don't fully agree with this - after all, evolution hasn't stopped and given us perfect species, and without the fitting natural selection, the low hanging fruit may still be there - but I can see what he means. <br/><br/>The second point is that competitive success is better than success by persisting - for example,  forests or ecosystems usually don't compete against each other, so there is no telling whether their actual composition is ""ideal"" or not - maybe yes, maybe no, the point is that the blind copying of this abundance can either help or hurt, we have no clue as to what outside pressures these compositions developed. Just because they have persisted doesn't mean that should blindly copy them.<br/><br/>In these chapters are the best (and most science-fiction-ish) ideas - for example, wheat grows larger because of inter-individual competition for light, which isn't good for us humans since then yield is lower, the plant has to put resources into growing instead of into our food. Borlaug reversed this process by introducing dwarf wheat with a much higher yield. Denison propose that we create plants that actually cooperate each other, for example, by making sure that plants in the vicinity get enough light, while the plants grow in such a way that harmful weeds are shaded. Quite outlandish, but doable! There's also a very interesting discussion on assisting plants in selecting for ""helpful"" rhizobia in varying nodules.<br/><br/>Right now our only successes in plant modification is that they express toxins, which is relatively easy, it's just a single gene that isn't particularly part of any system. If you start to modify salinity resistance, for example, the image gets bleaker - we've had some success by introducing ion pumps from salinity-resistant species, but these systems are still too unknown to drastically improve yield. Changing species so that they cooperate, that's still far, far away.<br/><br/>The third point is a relatively obvious one - we should always hedge bets and not bet on just one approach, this chapter is a bit more political as it includes various taxing schemes (an interesting Nitrogen-tax is proposed where farmers pay per kg of Nitrogen used, but get a tax bonus for every kg that is actually used - for example, 1000kg of wheat use 23kg of Nitrogen, so these 23kg would receive a bonus).<br/><br/>I don't always agree with his ideas, for example, he's a bit disappointed that so much money is being poured into the various -omics approaches while the ""classic"" fields of ecology and agronomy are being underfunded, he's disappointed that so many people work with <i>Arabidopsis</i> while there are so many alternative plants to work at, but I think that the omics stuff is still so early, and we still know so little about other, more complicated plants that it makes sense to keep on working with the relatively simple <i>Arabidopsis</i>.. For now. Some people try to model the human brain, but more people are working on the simple <i>C. elegans</i> with its exactly 302 neurons. <br/><br/>Bonus quote:<br/><blockquote><br/>Do legumes, like the farm-owners in The Grapes of Wrath, advertise more openings than actually exist, to attract a surplus of applicants?<br/></blockquote><br/><br/>Recommended for: Plant biologists, breeders, interested laymen, people interested in the future of agriculture, people interested in the big picture",,,,,,0,,,,,

It begins with how to start your job-hunt, finding your strengths, updating your Linkedin (reasonable tips there!), and finding the job that suits you. Since programming interviews are often technical in nature, the majority of this book focuses on these parts. It goes over all the basic data-structures and gives you a couple of example problems from interviews for each structure. These are good in that the author goes through a ""natural"" thinking process with each problem - starting with the ""obvious"" and ""easy"" solution, showing where the caveats are, ""loudly"" thinking about possible ways to solve it, finding the ""good"" solution, and then sometimes going further to the ""perfect"" solution (which doesn't help in interviews, but is there for pure nerd-satisfaction). <br/><br/>After a problem was solved in ""plain text"", example programs are included. These are written in Java, C++ or C. A warning here: Many solutions include low-level concepts like pointers (or even pointers to pointers), so if you've only programmed in languages without ""manual pointers"" like Python or Ruby this book won't help you much. In fact, the String problems are a little bit frustrating to read when you know the solution in Python would be a (slow) one-liner like my_string.split("" "")[::-1] (that one's surprisingly complicated in C).<br/><br/>After going through all the basic data-structures like binary trees, stacks, heaps, strings etc. a couple of non-datastructure CS related things pop up, like graphics programming, concurrency, SQL etc., which I rarely see, but good to see them included here. Then there are a few chapters on the typical ""riddles"", like <a href=""http://www.coolmath4kids.com/math_puzzles/l1-threelights.html"">this one</a> (which doesn't even work with modern light-bulbs - LEDs don't get hot, fluorescent bulbs only a little), but the authors rightly state that these are cheap pot-shots which don't really help in anything. But since they come up in interviews, they had to be included. The book concludes with a couple of examples for ""knowledge""-based questions, and a helpful appendix on structuring/writing CVs.<br/><br/>Recommended for: Job-hunting programmers, or those in the last year of their studies. People who've never been to a technical programming interview and would like to know what to expect. People who like to solve programming riddles. People who need a crash-course/refresher on data-structures and algorithms.<br/><br/>Not recommended for: Beginning programmers (too much low-level stuff). People who only program in high-level languages like Python or Ruby. People who want to study programming interview questions specifically - there are other, bigger, more complete books on that (but I don't really see the purpose behind that - in my own experience, people who learn programming solutions by heart [they exist!] can't program at all, which will hopefully become obvious in the interview).<br/>",,,,,,0,,,,,

There's a bit of essays on Wallace, his success and suicide around the interviews from Lipsky, but the majority of the books is Wallace's answers and elaborations of answers to questions of Lipsky. I'd say 80% of the text is Wallace speaking, and it's great to read the thoughts of someone who's so upfront and honest about himself:<br/><br/><blockquote><br/>What I’m trying to say to you is, I went through a period so bad, that that stuff had to stop mattering to me, or I think I would’ve blown my brains out. I came reasonably close.</blockquote> <br/><br/>From time to time Lipsky injects his personal observations into the texts with [brackets like this], which feels like Lipsky is trying to remind the reader that Lipsky still exists, they don't add much and often break the flow of the answer.<br/><br/>Worthy of a read just because of this quote (and now I spoiled it for you!)<br/><br/><blockquote><br/>I think the reason why people behave in an ugly manner is that it’s really scary to be alive and to be human, and people are really really afraid. And that the reasons [...] That the fear is the basic condition, and there are all kinds of reasons for why we’re so afraid. But the fact of the matter is, is that, is that the job that we’re here to do is to learn how to live in a way that we’re not terrified all the time. And not in a position of using all kinds of different things, and using people to keep that kind of terror at bay. That is my personal opinion.<br/></blockquote><br/><br/>Addendum: Both Lipsky and Wallace were huge TV-watchers, with a section on how both can easily watch TV for 6-8 hours straight - is it just me or has that died? I know no-one who can watch that much TV without doing anything else, I can't watch TV <i>alone</i> for longer than 10 minutes before I open my laptop. Changing times?<br/>",,,,,,0,,,,,

Since the star spins so fast, ""time"" on the star progresses faster for the lifeforms - about 15 human minutes are one of their generation. A large part of the book focuses on the developments on the planet, and how the Cheela develop from stone age-like warriors to space-travellers surpassing humans. <br/><br/>This is hard SF with a focus on physics, and by hard I mean <i>hard</i> to the point of unreadable:<br/><br/><blockquote><br/>The cables became longer and longer and started to react to the magnetic field lines of the star, which were whipping by them ten times a second—five sweeps of a positive magnetic field emanating from the east pole of the neutron star, interspersed with five sweeps of the negative magnetic field from the west pole.<br/></blockquote><br/><br/>(Other science is kind of bollocks though - why is their DNA-equivalent triple-stranded? Why is their math apparently base 10 when (IIRC) they have 12 appendixes and 12 eyes?) <br/><br/>There's a couple of really cool ideas, for example when humans (unaware of intelligent life at that point) start to use lasers for a few minutes to map the planet, the beings on the surface quickly develop a religion around the lasers. Makes you realize that your smallest actions can have huge consequences somewhere else.<br/><br/>As it's normal with hard SF, all characters are made out of cardboard, just there to progress the story. But what's up with all women being ""beautiful""? Are people not allowed to look normal? It's kind of creepy to have the woman's beauty described every time she says something intelligent. Men apparently don't have looks in this world.<br/><br/>Recommended for: Friends of SF<br/><br/>Not recommended for: Everyone else",,,,,,0,,,,,

Since it's a history book, there are no characters or no dialogue - it's a bit like reading a summary of Game Of Thrones stuck on fast-forward. There are intrigues, murders, back-room deals, affairs, discussions, more murders, civil war, famous philosophers, stupidly rich people, fun quirks (only bavarians drink milk or eat sitting up!), and more.<br/><br/>I can't really say how accurate it is, since the majority of my knowledge of the time involves one fat and one tiny Frenchman, but it certainly is interesting, if not at times confusing for the large number of protagonists. It's also fun to match the values of Rome to some current superpowers:<br/><br/><blockquote><br/>Enthusiasts for empire argued that Rome had a civilising mission; that because her values and institutions were self-evidently superior to those of barbarians, she had a duty to propagate them; that only once the whole globe had been subjected to her rule could there be a universal peace.

Especially the first five to ten chapters are grating - the majority of the book is written in the form of a journal/log, but it's written more like the LiveJournal of a teenager than a mission's log. Some quotes:<br/><br/><blockquote><br/>Holy shit this is awesome! Holy shit! Holy shit! <br/>Ok calm.

The book is best in Simonini's ethical gymnastics (as in, 'I don't forge documents, I create documents that should have existed in the first place') and various murderous shenanigans.<br/><br/>The rather convoluted structure of the novel, with one narrator summarizing a diary held jointly by the master forger Simonini and a priest who may or may not be Simonini, didn't add anything to the novel at all (to me).<br/><br/>Still worlds better than <i>The Mysterious Flame of Queen Loana</i>.<br/><br/>Recommended for: Fans of historical fiction, Eco is still the best at that.<br/>Not recommended for: People with zero knowledge of European history, I guess it'll get confusing fast.<br/><br/>P.S.: You have to choose where you read this, I'm pretty sure it's weird when your seat neighbour on the bus reads pagelong rants about how the Jews are behind everything",,,,,,0,,,,,

If not, just watch <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQ4KzClb1C4"">this scene</a>. Needless to say, it's <b>great</b>: ""Oh hi Mark!"". <br/><br/>If you ever wondered how that movie came to be, here's The Disaster Artist, by one of the movie's co-stars: Greg Sestero (who's Mark in the above scene). Did you know it cost 6 million dollars? Did you know it took forever to film? Did you know Wiseau kept on forgetting basic sentences <b>he himself wrote</b>? Did you know still no-one really knows where all this money came from? Did you know Wiseau is as weird in real life as he is in the movie?<br/><br/>Here Sestero describes how he met Wiseau at acting school, how he tried to get his acting career to start, his continuing friendship with Wiseau (and absolute bafflement about Wiseau, the alien/vampire/dork?), culminating in Wiseau making <i>The Room</i>, and the absolute trainwreck of the filming, which form the main part of the book. It's also the funniest.<br/><br/>The best thing about this book is that Sestero could have taken the low road of just making fun of Wiseau's absolute weirdness, and it would have destroyed the book. But instead, we get introspective sentences like this:<br/><br/><blockquote><br/>In the end, the phenomenon of The Room has allowed me to realize that, in life, anything is possible. The Room is a drama that is also a comedy that is also an existential cry for help that is finally a testament to human endurance. It has made me reconsider what defines artistic success or failure. If art is expression, can it fail?

She had an interesting style of invention - during her wartime work, necessity was the mother of invention (""we need these bombing tables and we need them yesterday"", so sub-routines were invented so several problems could be attacked at once), but after it, much of her work was inspired by making programming easier and more accessible - less formulas, more English, and a ton of teaching to get more people into programming. A very inspiring story. <br/><br/>There are other very interesting parts here - in describing Hopper's way of ""distributed invention"" I was often reminded of Raymond's <a href=""https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/134825.The_Cathedral_the_Bazaar"">""The Cathedral and the Bazaar""</a>, her work was immediately shared with the community of programmers and mathematicians and their ideas were implemented (""Bazaar""-style invention, here called ""distributed invention"") which led to many improvements in A-1 and A-2. On the other hand, her work in the committee that designed COBOL was more of a ""Cathedral"" situation - a top-down committee of experts that first wrote the standard, then implemented the language.<br/><br/>Other parts reminded me of Brooks' <a href=""https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/13629.The_Mythical_Man_Month"">""The Mythical Man Month""</a> - some of their early day ""tricks"" with the Mark 1 computers (such as a library of subroutines so they'd have code that has been shown to work correctly, for example, the sin() function) is repeated as a tip in Brooks' book. And there's only about 40 years in between!<br/><br/>General Groves, who plays a relatively important part in Ray Monk's <a href=""https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/12041966-robert-oppenheimer"">biography of Oppenheimer</a> as Oppenheimer's ""military counterpart"" at the Manhattan Project, re-appears here as one of Hopper's bosses at Remington Rand. What a weird coincidence.<br/><br/>Of course, no history book wouldn't be without some ridiculously dry parts. This is definitely not ""pop"" history! I had to make more coffee when it came to the details of which committee did what and how their roles were defined, who sat at which position etc. during the creation of COBOL.<br/><br/>Recommended for: People interested in the history of computing or computers<br/><br/>Not recommended for: People who don't get a laugh out of <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grace_Hopper#/media/File:H96566k.jpg"">this picture</a>",,,,,,0,,,,,

Another story with an ""industry espionage detective"" first dragged on forever and it felt like Barron wanted to go into cyberpunk territory, but then turned 180 degrees and became a horror story that reminded me more of Barker's Hellraiser (chains! blood! torture!) than Lovecraft's stuff.

Working at Amazon isn't much fun, in fact it's kind of terrifying<br/><br/><blockquote><br/>People left and afterward they took a breath and felt disoriented, like they had escaped a cult. Though they didn’t share it openly, many just couldn’t take working for Bezos any longer. He demanded more than they could possibly deliver and was extremely stingy with praise. At the same time, many felt a tremendous loyalty to Bezos and would later marvel at how much they accomplished at Amazon. Kim Rachmeler shared a favorite quote she heard from a colleague around that time. “If you’re not good, Jeff will chew you up and spit you out. And if you’re good, he will jump on your back and ride you into the ground.”<br/></blockquote><br/><br/>or<br/><br/><blockquote><br/>Managers in departments of fifty people or more are required to “top-grade” their subordinates along a curve and must dismiss the least effective performers. As a result of this ongoing examination, many Amazon employees live in perpetual fear. A common experience among Amazon workers is a feeling of genuine surprise when one receives a good performance review. Managers are so parsimonious with compliments that underlings tend to spend their days anticipating their termination.<br/></blockquote><br/><br/>(But: I used to work under similar ""screamy"" people, so I learned to just ignore their tantrums, so all fine on that front?)<br/><br/>2. but it can also be inspiring and apparently you learn heaps [1]:<br/><br/><blockquote><br/>“Jeff does a couple of things better than anyone I’ve ever worked for,” Dalzell says. “He embraces the truth. A lot of people talk about the truth, but they don’t engage their decision-making around the best truth at the time. “The second thing is that he is not tethered by conventional thinking. What is amazing to me is that he is bound only by the laws of physics. He can’t change those. Everything else he views as open to discussion.”<br/></blockquote><br/><br/>3. And since Amazon has become such a huge market-power, they've behaved more than dodgy (and Bezos' sayings like ""Customer first"" sound hollow)<br/><br/><blockquote><br/>Amazon had an easy way to demonstrate its market power. When a publisher did not capitulate and the company shut off the recommendation algorithms for its books, the publisher’s sales usually fell by as much as 40 percent. “Typically it was about thirty days before they’d come back and say, Ouch, how do we make this work?” says Christopher Smith, a senior book buyer at the time.<br/></blockquote><br/><br/>4. Several passages reminded me of <a href=""https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/10091466-inside-scientology"">Inside Scientology</a>, in the description of ""Jeff bots"", people who try to emulate Bezos in thinking and behaviour tcoming close to Hubbard's Sea Org:<br/><br/><blockquote><br/>“Jeff was learning as he went along. He learned things from each of us who had expertise and incorporated the best pieces into his mental model. Now everyone is expected to think as much as they can like Jeff.” Bezos’s top executives are always modeling Bezos-like behavior.<br/></blockquote> <br/><br/>So would I recommend this book? I learned that Amazon had more failures than successes, which is good to know - in retrospect it all looks like one huge success story. It also explains recent developments like Amazon's drone program, Bezos isn't scared of having far-out ideas and then pursuing them relentlessly. <br/><br/>One thing that scares me is the similarity to Apple's Steve Jobs - both not really nice people to work under, and both willing to bend and break ethics to get what they wanted. ""Some"" people see that as the reason for their success and try to emulate this behaviour. You can be extremely successful and not sell your soul - look at <a href=""https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/13482884-our-daily-bread-the-essential-norman-borlaug"">Norman Borlaug</a>, father of the green revolution, also founder of the Mexican softball league, who made sure that all of his ""lower level"" employees received university education. Or look at Valve's Steve Gaben, who gives sick employees the official job-title of ""getting better"" and pays them until they are OK again. Bezos doesn't even pay parking fees.<br/><br/>[1] yay for Australian English: Mixing data-structures and language since 1901<br/><br/>Addendum:<br/><br/>Where does success come from? It seems that most of the current Silicon Valley higher-ups had very good childhoods, with special schools, extremely early access to computers, special schooling programs for gifted children, etc. Look at Bill Gates or Jeff Bezos. At the same time, their adult versions worked extremely hard, much more than 99% of the rest of the world, and of course had luck at the right time, and were uncompromising in their ""big thinking"".

Thomas Ligotti has built himself a nice house in that valley.<br/><br/>To summarize the thesis of this non-fiction book/treatise: being alive is <i>not</i> alright, optimists are deceiving themselves and others, the future will <i>not</i> be better, the creation of consciousness was a huge mistake, life is useless and painful to boot, and humanity would do itself a favor by collectively deciding to not have children anymore: to stop perpetuate this madness. <br/><br/>To quote:<br/><br/><blockquote>Consciousness makes it seem as if (1) there is something to do; (2) there is somewhere to go; (3) there is something to be; (4) there is someone to know. This is what makes consciousness the parent of all horrors, the thing that makes us try to do something, go somewhere, be something, and know someone, such as ourselves, so that we can escape our MALIGNANTLY USELESS being and think that being alive is all right rather than that which should not be.</blockquote> (yes, MALIGNANTLY USELESS is always capitalized)<br/><br/>or<br/><br/><blockquote><br/>Beef, pork, sometimes goat—they go into us and come out of us. This is part of the regimen of nonsense that nature forced upon us. But it is not all the nonsense we must endure as we go to and fro on the earth and walk up and down upon it. The nature nonsense, the God nonsense. How much nonsense can we take in our lives? And is there any way we can escape it? No, there is not. We are doomed to all kinds of nonsense: the pain nonsense, the nightmare nonsense, the sweat and slave nonsense, and many other shapes and sizes of insufferable nonsense. It is brought to us on a plate, and we must eat it up or face the death nonsense.<br/></blockquote><br/><br/>He quotes extensively from <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Wessel_Zapffe"">Zapffe</a>, Schopenhauer, <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philipp_Mainl%C3%A4nder"">Mainländer</a>, Lovecraft (awesome) and others to make his case - sometimes, the book feels more like an expansion of Zapffe's ideas... Neither Zapffe nor Mainländer were known to me before; I guess both are reasonably unknown, since the majority of Zapffe's work remains untranslated.<br/><br/>But: there is a dark strange form of humor at work here; reading the book I couldn't help but think that getting drunk with Ligotti must be great fun.<br/><br/>You do see that he's got a background as a horror writer:<br/><br/><blockquote>We are aberrations—beings born undead, neither one thing nor another, or two things at once … uncanny things that have nothing to do with the rest of creation, horrors that poison the world by sowing our madness everywhere we go, glutting daylight and darkness with incorporeal obscenities.</blockquote><br/><br/>Recommended for: Remember the Nietzsche quote, ""when you gaze long into an abyss the abyss also gazes into you""? This book is for people who love getting into staring contests with the abyss.<br/><br/>Not recommended for: Psychologically labile people. Teddy Daniels from Shutter Island.

Both books seem to be worried about the militarization of the treatment of both cancer and AIDS, as in ""the war on cancer""/""the war on AIDS"" and all that follows of these ways of thinking (including calls for internment of HIV-positive people etc.).<br/><br/>The first book on tuberculosis/cancer is more outdated than the second - I rarely encounter many points it refutes, much of which was spread in the early to mid 19th European literature, for example, that cancer is due to (paraphrased) someone not really being in contact with their feelings. I think only hippies still believe that. It's also weird that the book so often refutes points made by Georg Groddeck and Wilhelm Reich, both of which are now mostly known for their crazy ideas and not much else (I remember a poor soul who had to hold a talk about Groddeck's ""The Book Of The It"" in high school German, to the general amusement of everyone - I mean, ""you break your leg only if you want to?"" what is <i>that</i>)<br/><br/>The second book on AIDS is better, but contains a bit of repetition from the first one (since both were published several years apart). <br/><br/><br/>Recommended for: Skeptics who want to see someone refute common beliefs of their time.

I would not recommend it to biologists or those without any programming experience - for that, it assumes to much of the reader - but for programmers thinking of going into bioinformatics, or bioinformaticians who've dabbled a bit with the shell, this is a gold-mine.<br/><br/>It starts off with good advice like this one:<br/><br/><blockquote><br/>In teaching bioinformatics, I often share this idea as the Golden Rule of Bioinformatics: NEVER EVER TRUST YOUR TOOLS (OR DATA) This isn’t to make you paranoid that none of bioinformatics can be trusted, or that you must test every available program and parameter on your data. Rather, this is to train you to adopt the same cautious attitude software engineers and bioinformaticians have learned the hard way.<br/></blockquote><br/><br/>and how to structure and document your projects, then a short intro to using bash, one chapter on git, a bit of ssh, working with data, various useful Unix tools (you know, awk, sort etc.), a VERY dense introduction to R, bioconductor, GenomicRanges, dplyr, ggplot2 (this felt like the bulk of the book, possibly because R is the one thing I had the least experience with from the stuff in the book), an intro to some common file-formats like fasta/fastq/sam/bam and some of their related tools (samtools/bedtools), then a bit of streaming data, and closing with a quick introduction to SQL using SQLite. All of that crammed into ~300 pages! It's a dense book.<br/><br/>Luckily he introduces only the ""timeless"" stuff, the tools that should still be around in a few years. There's no introduction to read aligners here, for example, these change all the time. The tone is lively and direct and not overcomplicated, but I can't stress this enough, absolute programming beginners <i>will</i> struggle. For those there are other introductory books (like Haddock/Dunn's 'Practical Computing For Biologists').<br/><br/>On the other hand, if you're an advanced bioinformatician somewhere at the end of your PhD or even past that much in this book may bore you; in that case, it's always nice to see how colleagues go about their work. For example, why have I always googled SAM flags like some caveman instead of simply using 'samtools flags'?<br/><br/>Yet this book fills a niche that I've always wanted to see a book in - the relatively tool-agnostic, ""how to go about your job in the most efficient way possible"" niche.",,,,,,0,,,,,

But none of this mattered one bit in my judgement of her, for she had something else, which was more improtant: she was a focal point.""). Every few pages I found a part of myself in this book, maybe because I had a similar youth as Knausgard [1] - things like the deadness of the small town he grew up in, it's weird how he writes how <i>I</i>, and a lot of other people, feel about my hometown; things like his complicated non-relationship with parents, in his case his father (who takes up most of the book, and it seems like, most of the space in Knausgard's head, too).<br/><br/>On the other hand, I can see how this might not be fun for many people - there's so much meandering going on in the book, as an example, Knausgard remembers that he used to sleepwalk and <i>bam</i>, the entire family's history of sleepwalking is described, there's no escape. So if you're looking for a logical story, you should look somewhere else - too much is happening here for that, Knausgard crams a level of detail in this that it's no wonder there are five more books, with a combined count of 3500 pags.

Maybe because I grew up in Germany? Do we have different childhoods? I don't think so..<br/><br/>Here we have Charlie, a highly intelligent, slightly mentally ill 15-year old (later 16) who writes letters about his daily life. Since he's so intelligent he hangs out with the older crowd, a couple of 17/18-year olds at his high-school. <br/><br/>The first half of the book was bad. Charlie doesn't think like a 15-year old, he and his friends think like mature, respectful 30-year olds. The biggest concern to me was the total and absolute lack of awkwardness, which to me is the major feeling of that certain age: most kisses at that age are ""he stuck his tongue so deep into my throat that I threw up"" [1], here kisses are beautiful and perfect moments forever stuck in time. Most social events at that age are ""she's young, she can't judge drinking, she drank so much Jägermeister in 20 minutes that she threw up on me"" [2], in this book they are gatherings of like-minded artists who read each other poetry. That is the worst part - everyone is such a unique quirky snowflake (we discuss The Smiths! We read poetry! We make punk zines! We drive pickups! We drink brandy!); no-one is really a character, everyone is just there to allude to pop culture. Of course there has to be a gay couple there as well, they're not gay because of the way the characters are but they are gay so that the book can be oh-so-progressive. It reminded me a lot of the movie Juno, where similarly everybody is quirky for quirkiness' sake.<br/><br/>The second half got better: Chbosky perfectly captures the moment when your childhood friendships dissolve and everybody starts their own life; you get nostalgic for that time. But then you realize that he knows he inflicts these emotions, you feel that he constructed this not to write ""the truth"" but to toy with your emotions, and that is when you feel like taking a shower. After I finished the book I would've given it 3 or 4 stars mainly because of these scenes; now a day later the effect has worn off, luckily. <br/><br/>On the language: Some of these one-off sentences like ""at this moment, we felt infinite"" feel painfully cheesy like Coelho, it's not even funny.<br/><br/>[1] Disclaimer: Never happened to me<br/><br/>[2] Disclaimer: Happened to me",,,,,,0,,,,,

Then the book goes over to the coup d'etat by the current boss David Miscavige, details the death of Lisa McPherson and the personal role of Miscavige in it, the ""star power"" strategy of Scientology (you know, Tom Cruise, John Travolta, surprisingly to me: Nancy Cartwright, the voice of Bart Simpson), and concludes with the current rise of splinter-groups who agree with Hubbard's teaching but don't agree with how the church is handled.<br/><br/>What will make you angry is the ""evil"" (for lack of a better term) done by the church or its followers. The harassment of IRS-personnel to get a ""tax exempt"" status, the harassment of ex-members, the non-relenting suing of everyone not agreeing with Scientology, the creepiness of Hubbard and Miscavige (Hubbard had a personal staff of 15-year old girls as ""messengers"" who ran his errands for him, held his drinks, lighted his cigarettes etc. - Miscavige regularly beats people up and plays cruel mind-games, like forcing all of his staff to play ""around the world or they're 'out'"", which leads to physical fights between people for chairs), the shameful story of McPherson's death (Miscavige personally declared her ""Clear"" so a nervous breakdown should be impossible, but she suffered a nervous breakdown, since that wasn't possible they kept her under wraps and didn't give her much medical help. She died of dehydration which the church immediately started to cover up. The coroner changed her report later [it is implied under personal pressure by Scientology] so that the organization didn't get sued). So much more: The weirdness of the whole Tom Cruise-involvement is worth to read this book alone.<br/><br/>It makes you happy that Germany officially sees Scientology as a cult.<br/><br/>It was a bit discomforting to read that some of my fav. Golden Age SF writers like AE Van Vogt were early Dianetics-followers, but I expected that from the more crazier authors like Burroughs (or even guys like Manson). Also surprised to see that the Nation of Islam (Malcolm X's church for half of his life until they kicked him out, see his auto-biography) has moved closer and closer to Scientology, they're now teaching Dianetics.<br/><br/>The only positive things I took away from the book is that currently, Scientology is bleeding high-level members because Miscavige treats everyone like the complete sociopath he seems to be, and that Scientology has less members than I thought - by one count in 2008, 25,000 in the US.<br/><br/>Recommended for: those who need more proof that the most damage is done by people who think they're doing ""good"". Those who still believe in people.<br/><br/>Not recommended for: People with blood pressure problems, may induce heart attack.",,,,,,0,,,,,

67880,The Outsider,Colin Wilson,"Wilson, Colin",,"=""0753814323""","=""9780753814321""",4,4.08,Phoenix,Paperback,322,2001,1956,2014/09/15,2013/12/07,non-fiction,non-fiction (#45),read,"Here's some rambling.<br/><br/>A history of 'The Outsider', the person who wants to 'live more abundantly', sees reality as unreal, sees himself outside of society, full of people that are 'asleep'. The Outsider is alone. Wilson describes the definition and the problems of the Outsider by using literature (particularly Hesse, and a great re-interpretation of Dostoevsky's lifework) and the lives of a few Outsiders like T.E. Lawrence, van Gogh and the ballet dancer Nijinsky. To Wilson, all of these men failed at their task of 'solving' the problems of the outsider. Some committed 'mind-suicide' by turning away from these questions, some like Hesse died before they could finish their path, others like Nietzsche or Nijinsky went crazy [1], others like van Gogh killed themselves. You see, it's not an easy path.<br/><br/>The book is about 60 years old, but its main questions are still valid and as unsolved as they were back then. It seems the work on these questions died together with the counter-culture of the 70s. A few contemporary writers (such as Bret Easton Ellis or Tao Lin) touch on the themes of the Outsider's alienation, but then immediately coil back and devolve into a numbing: mindless sex, drugs, etc.<br/><br/>If you've felt yourself as an 'Outsider', then this book is for you. Wilson published it when he was just 24 [2], I believe people older than that could not have written a similar book. Maybe I just found my niche in society and stopped thinking so much about the absurdity of it all? Have I, like T. E. Lawrence, committed mind-suicide?<br/><br/>I'm not the biggest fan of his path towards a solution of these problems, which he apparently developed more in subsequent books; it's too much religion, too much mysticism for me (for example: is there a realization of the self, or is it just self-deceit, a replacement for a purpose in life? I don't even think the 'self' exists, something which Wilson sometimes touches on ['we are a collection of Is'], but then immediately goes back to assuming that the 'self' is a thing, and therefore, a 'higher' level of life is possible. I'm not really convinced that is possible in the first place.).<br/><br/>Anyway, these problems still exist, they haven't magically dissolved in clouds of logic. It's a shame that we as a society have just covered the Outsider's problems in layers of irony to pretend they don't exist (in that point, David Foster Wallace was absolutely right).<br/><br/>[1] There's an interesting anecdote in the book - when Nijinsky went crazy, he stood in the middle of the street with a cross, asking people if they had found Jesus - a man informed his wife, he had witnessed Nietzsche doing exactly the same thing 10 years before, when Nietzsche went crazy.<br/>[2] Impressive how many books, writers, ideas he cites; and for how many writers he has strong opinions (Dostoevsky, for example, is a 'shoddy craftsman'). I'm now 4 years older and I haven't even read half of these books.",,,,,,0,,,,,

A human is sent to one of the outer Sirian planets to stir things up. The protagonist is sent with unlimited money and advanced tech to impersonate an entire rebel army by distributing propaganda, killing people, bombing people etc. There is no moral in here since Sirians are Others and the ones he kills are always overtly characterized as being ""evil"", no ambiguity there. How he succeeds at his terrorist mission is at times fun and at times surprisingly well-thought out.<br/><br/>Without spoilering too much, the ending is actually exactly like I would imagine such a story in real life to end. No overtly heroic stuff, that was unexpected from books of the era - you would expect the guy with the chiseled chin to ride off into the sunset with the love of his life.<br/><br/>Of course, since it's Golden Age SF the protagonist is one-dimensional (feelings are boring, characters are boring, let's have more story), overpowered (unlimited money!

The book draws a lot from Joseph Campbell's stuff on myths and symbolism (Campbell appears several times in the book) but most of it you can still see as just being symbolic - just because Marlantes talks about the god Mars doesn't mean he himself believes that such a god exists, it's just his way to explain the ""inner warrior"". I guess it's geared towards the US public and towards decision makers - war is exhilarating which is a taboo to talk about, but it's also terrible to see your friends die, and for Marlantes there are simply not enough rituals inside the army and for returning veterans to help them cope in order to get back into society.<br/><br/>It's one of the more brutally honest books I've read about war.<br/><br/>The only drawbacks: sometimes the spiritualism is <i>too</i> heavy handed for me, and sometimes it falls into really antiquated gender roles (no wonder when you base it on ""gods"" or a symbol of those - fertility gods are female, war gods are male).",,,,,,0,,,,,

(It reminds me of a guy I had with me on the bus on a trip through Spain - he was Spanish, spoke fluent German, it was 9am and he was coked up to the roof of his head, smelled like a bar and said that he'd been up for three days [his smell nodded and said ""I am here to confirm""]; he alternated between ""man here everything's a big party"" and ""I wish God would kill me instead of a child, I'm tired of living"")<br/><br/>But I don't know, I'm just tired of ennui, cynicism and irony in literature; since this book came out a million others have tried to copy the style, and now I can't stand this anymore.

This is one of these books - set in a Lovecraftian universe with unspeakable evil waiting out there, doing higher mathematics can open gates or call these creatures to possess you or your surroundings. There's a secret government agency charged with finding mathematicians stumbling into the wrong invocations, who promptly recruit them to protect the world. Two stories - the larger one featuring Nazis, alternative universes, body possession, and a shorter one featuring bureaucratic powerplays.<br/><br/>As with Accelerando (which I aborted and may need to give another chance), Stross loves throwing out technical sentences that make no sense. In Accelerando it was stuff like <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_neural_network"">artificial neural networks</a> behaving like AI, here it's sentences like ""I fuzzed its eigenvector but good"", or this one:<br/><br/><blockquote><br/>So this thing... it's a very precise transformation through the Mandelbrot set. Which you guys have used as a map onto a Linde continuum, right? Why don't they just set up an n-dimensional homogeneous matrix transformation? It's so much more intuitively obvious.""<br/></blockquote><br/><br/>Star Trek's techno-babble is at least internally consistent!<br/><br/>Yet Stross seems to have worked in IT in a large organisation, there's quite a few people who might find this funny:<br/><br/><blockquote><br/>Harriet has been having problems with her email system and asked my advice; I don't know quite what went wrong, but she ended up blowing five days of the departmental training budget attending a course on sendmail configuration. Took her three weeks to stop twitching every time somebody mentioned rules.<br/></blockquote><br/><br/>Some more ""bad"" things: Every character speaks and behaves exactly the same, the protagonist's love interest is a nerd Gibson wet-dream (hot! goth clothes! stays up all night to read Knuth! etc. pp.), the protagonist just knows stuff the story needs him to know (he goes from system administrator to knowing how to defuse an atomic bomb in ~80 pages), several glaring plot-holes (why is there a experienced secret specialized anti-paranormal SAS unit but all of them see magic for the first time when the protagonist uses it?), framing the holocaust as a needed sacrifice for a death spell is pretty bad taste, and more. But well, as the afterword says (weirdly defensive): ""Nobody forced you to read it by holding a gun to your head"". <br/><br/>I guess fans of Dresden Files or The Martian might like this, similar humor. Or system-admins who know the BOFH archive by heart.<br/><br/>P.S.: Interestingly, there's a joke about GCHQ listening on Americans while the NSA listens in on the British so both agencies can exchange intel without doing something illegal - something which was officially proven about 8 years after this book came out.",,,,,,0,,,,,

It was like this:<br/><br/>here are some numbers, put them into the formula for the t-test, when the number that comes out is below 0.05 write ""I reject the Null Hypothesis with a p-value of X"". I never really learned about the basic assumptions behind this test (and all the other ones), nor did I learn about how to interpret and actually <i>think</i> about these results. Did I make mistakes in my analysis? What are possible mistakes? What could I do better? <i>What did I actually do there?</i><br/><br/>Here's a great book for exactly that set of problems - it starts off with an introduction and explanation of all the basic words and teachings of statistics (p-values, cutoffs, etc.), then goes to the basic tests (t-test, non-parametric tests, ANOVA etc.).. each method isn't introduced from the math angle, in fact the book has maybe 5 to 10 formulas, but lists the basic assumptions of the method and what you can glance from the results.<br/><br/>One caveat: Like most statisticians, Motulsky has opinions: 95% CIs are more intuitive to understand than t-tests, basing analyses on smoothed data is crap, etc. Might not be everyone's cup of tea. Motulsky also the author of the GraphPrism software for statistical analysis so that one's frequently featured (example: ""I made this analysis using Graphpad.""). To make up for that, there's an appendix on R and Excel.<br/><br/>Can a book be bad that features 4 or 5 XKCD comics? Can a book be bad when the author trawls amazon.com and writes <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/Studyguide-Intuitive-Biostatistics-Nonmathematical-Statistical/dp/1478497548"">bad reviews for fraudulent study guides</a>?

But if you want to work in stats later it might be a good decision to read through this book.",,,,,,0,,,,,

A lot about politics, propaganda and modern life (both haven't really changed since then it seems), the most impressive thing to me is that even though he nowadays counts as a socialist, he can impartially describe the follies of both left and right without falling for the lies and (self-)deceptions of either side. I don't know any ""modern"" (as in, currently alive) writers who can do this.<br/><br/>As a sidenote, one can find many ""famous"" formulations of Animal Farm or 1984 in these essays before they appeared in the books.<br/><br/>If you read one essay of his, choose this one: <a href=""http://alexgolec.github.io/orwell/politics"">Politics and the English Language</a>, probably the most relevant to contemporary times.<br/><br/>I've underlined about a hundred insightful passages which I'm just going to paste here so that you can get a general idea. All others can stop here.<br/><br/><br/>(Keep in mind that most of these essays are written 1938-1949)<br/><br/>It seems to me a safe assumption that the disease loosely called nationalism is now almost universal. Antisemitism is only one manifestation of nationalism, and not everyone will have the disease in that particular form. A Jew, for example, would not be antisemitic: but then many Zionist Jews seem to me to be merely antisemites turned upside-down, just as many Indians and Negroes display the normal colour prejudices in an inverted form.<br/><br/><br/>But that antisemitism will be definitively CURED, without curing the larger disease of nationalism, I do not believe.<br/><br/>Political or military commentators, like astrologers, can survive almost any mistake, because their more devoted followers do not look to them for an appraisal of the facts but for the stimulation of nationalistic loyalties.<br/><br/>In 1927 Chiang Kai Shek boiled hundreds of Communists alive, and yet within ten years he had become one of the heroes of the Left. The re-alignment of world politics had brought him into the anti-Fascist camp, and so it was felt that the boiling of the Communists ‘didn’t count’, or perhaps had not happened.<br/><br/>PACIFIST: Those who ‘abjure’ violence can only do so because others are committing violence on their behalf<br/><br/>There is no limit to the follies that can be swallowed if one is under the influence of feelings of this kind. I have heard it confidently stated, for instance, that the American troops had been brought to Europe not to fight the Germans but to crush an English revolution. One has to belong to the intelligentsia to believe things like that: no ordinary man could be such a fool.<br/><br/>If you hate and fear Russia, if you are jealous of the wealth and power of America, if you despise Jews, if you have a sentiment of inferiority towards the British ruling class, you cannot get rid of those feelings simply by taking thought. But you can at least recognise that you have them, and prevent them from contaminating your mental processes.<br/><br/>But what this scene, and much else that I saw in Germany, brought home to me was that the whole idea of revenge and punishment is a childish daydream. Properly speaking, there is no such thing as revenge. Revenge is an act which you want to commit when you are powerless and because you are powerless: as soon as the sense of impotence is removed, the desire evaporates also. Who would not have jumped for joy, in 1940, at the thought of seeing S.S. officers kicked and humiliated? But when the thing becomes possible, it is merely pathetic and disgusting. It is said that when Mussolini’s corpse<br/><br/>At the international level sport is frankly mimic warfare. But the significant thing is not the behaviour of the players but the attitude of the spectators: and, behind the spectators, of the nations who work themselves into furies over these absurd contests, and seriously believe — at any rate for short periods — that running, jumping and kicking a ball are tests of national virtue.<br/><br/>Serious sport has nothing to do with fair play. It is bound up with hatred, jealousy, boastfulness, disregard of all rules and sadistic pleasure in witnessing violence: in other words it is war minus the shooting.<br/><br/>However, it appears from President Truman’s remarks, and various comments that have been made on them, that the bomb is fantastically expensive and that its manufacture demands an enormous industrial effort, such as only three or four countries in the world are capable of making. This point is of cardinal importance, because it may mean that the discovery of the atomic bomb, so far from reversing history, will simply intensify the trends which have been apparent for a dozen years past.<br/><br/>But suppose — and really this the likeliest development — that the surviving great nations make a tacit agreement never to use the atomic bomb against one another? Suppose they only use it, or the threat of it, against people who are unable to retaliate? In that case we are back where we were before, the only difference being that power is concentrated in still fewer hands and that the outlook for subject peoples and oppressed classes is still more hopeless.<br/><br/>If you plant a walnut you are planting it for your grandchildren, and who cares a damn for his grandchildren?<br/><br/>Every writer, in any case, is rather that kind of person, but the prolonged, indiscriminate reviewing of books is a quite exceptionally thankless, irritating and exhausting job. It not only involves praising trash — though it does involve that, as I will show in a moment — but constantly INVENTING reactions towards books about which one has no spontaneous feelings whatever.<br/><br/>People talk about the horrors of war, but what weapon has man invented that even approaches in cruelty some of the commoner diseases? “Natural” death, almost by definition, means something slow, smelly and painful.<br/><br/>This business of people just dying like animals, for instance, with nobody standing by, nobody interested, the death not even noticed till the morning — this happened more than once.<br/><br/>Machiavelli and his followers taught that in politics decency simply does not exist, and, by doing so, Burnham claims, made it possible to conduct political affairs more intelligently and less oppressively. A ruling class which recognised that its real aim was to stay in power would also recognise that it would be more likely to succeed if it served the common good, and might avoid stiffening into a hereditary aristocracy.<br/><br/>Socialism, until recently, was supposed to connote political democracy, social equality and internationalism. There is not the smallest sign that any of these things is in a way to being established anywhere, and the one great country in which something described as a proletarian revolution once happened, i.e. the USSR, has moved steadily away from the old concept of a free and equal society aiming at universal human brotherhood. In an almost unbroken progress since the early days of the Revolution, liberty has been chipped away and representative institutions smothered, while inequalities have increased and nationalism and militarism have grown stronger.<br/><br/>Political predictions are usually wrong, because they are usually based on wish-thinking, but they can have symptomatic value, especially when they change abruptly.<br/><br/>Such a world-picture fits in with the American tendency to admire size for its own sake and to feel that success constitutes justification, and it fits in with the all-prevailing anti-British<br/><br/>Burnham at least has the honesty to say that Socialism isn’t coming; the others merely say that Socialism is coming, and then give the word “Socialism” a new meaning which makes nonsense of the old one.<br/><br/>If I had to make a prophecy, I should say that a continuation of the Russian policies of the last fifteen years — and internal and external policy, of course, are merely two facets of the same thing — can only lead to a war conducted with atomic bombs, which will make Hitler’s invasion look like a tea-party. But at any rate, the Russian régime will either democratise itself, or it will perish. The huge, invincible, everlasting slave empire of which Burnham appears to dream will not be established, or, if established, will not endure, because slavery is no longer a stable basis for human society.<br/><br/>The question only arises because in exploring the physical universe man has made no attempt to explore himself. Much of what goes by the name of pleasure is simply an effort to destroy consciousness.<br/><br/>This mixture of vagueness and sheer incompetence is the most marked characteristic of modern English prose, and especially of any kind of political writing. As soon as certain topics are raised, the concrete melts into the abstract and no one seems able to think of turns of speech that are not hackneyed: prose consists less and less of WORDS chosen for the sake of their meaning, and more and more of PHRASES tacked together like the sections of a prefabricated hen-house.<br/><br/>PRETENTIOUS DICTION. Words like PHENOMENON, ELEMENT, INDIVIDUAL (as noun), OBJECTIVE, CATEGORICAL, EFFECTIVE, VIRTUAL, BASIS, PRIMARY, PROMOTE, CONSTITUTE, EXHIBIT, EXPLOIT, UTILIZE, ELIMINATE, LIQUIDATE, are used to dress up simple statements and give an air of scientific impartiality to biased judgments.<br/><br/><br/>MEANINGLESS WORDS. In certain kinds of writing, particularly in art criticism and literary criticism, it is normal to come across long passages which are almost completely lacking in meaning. * Words like ROMANTIC, PLASTIC, VALUES, HUMAN, DEAD, SENTIMENTAL, NATURAL, VITALITY, as used in art criticism, are strictly meaningless, in the sense that they not only do not point to any discoverable object, but are hardly even expected to do so by the reader. When one critic writes, “The outstanding feature of Mr. X’s work is its living quality,” while another writes, “The immediately striking thing about Mr. X’s work is its peculiar deadness,” the reader accepts this as a simple difference of opinion<br/><br/>In the case of a word like DEMOCRACY, not only is there no agreed definition, but the attempt to make one is resisted from all sides. It is almost universally felt that when we call a country democratic we are praising it: consequently the defenders of every kind of régime claim that it is a democracy, and fear that they might have to stop using the word if it were tied down to any one meaning. Words of this kind are often used in a consciously dishonest way. That is, the person who uses them has his own private definition, but allows his hearer to think he means something quite different.<br/><br/>As I have tried to show, modern writing at its worst does not consist in picking out words for the sake of their meaning and inventing images in order to make the meaning clearer. It consists in gumming together long strips of words which have already been set in order by someone else, and making the results presentable by sheer humbug.<br/><br/>A scrupulous writer, in every sentence that he writes, will ask himself at least four questions, thus: What am I trying to say? What words will express it? What image or idiom will make it clearer? Is this image fresh enough to have an effect? And he will probably ask himself two more: Could I put it more shortly? Have I said anything that is avoidably ugly? But you are not obliged to go to all this trouble. You can shirk it by simply throwing your mind open and letting the ready-made phrases come crowding in.<br/><br/>When one watches some tired hack on the platform mechanically repeating the familiar phrases — BESTIAL ATROCITIES, IRON HEEL, BLOODSTAINED TYRANNY, FREE PEOPLES OF THE WORLD, STAND SHOULDER TO SHOULDER— one often has a curious feeling that one is not watching a live human being but some kind of dummy:<br/><br/>In our time, political speech and writing are largely the defense of the indefensible. Things like the continuance of British rule in India, the Russian purges and deportations, the dropping of the atom bombs on Japan, can indeed be defended, but only by arguments which are too brutal for most people to face, and which do not square with the professed aims of political parties. Thus political language has to consist largely of euphemism, question-begging and sheer cloudy vagueness. Defenseless villages are bombarded from the air, the inhabitants driven out into the countryside, the cattle machine-gunned, the huts set on fire with incendiary bullets: this is called PACIFICATION.<br/><br/>The inflated style is itself a kind of euphemism. A mass of Latin words falls upon the facts like soft snow, blurring the outlines and covering up all the details. The great enemy of clear language is insincerity. When there is a gap between one’s real and one’s declared aims, one turns, as it were instinctively, to long words and exhausted idioms, like a cuttlefish squirting out ink. In our age there is no such thing as “keeping out of politics.” All issues are political issues, and politics itself is a mass of lies, evasions, folly, hatred and schizophrenia. When the general atmosphere is bad, language must suffer. I should expect to find — this is a guess which I have not sufficient knowledge to verify — that the German, Russian and Italian languages have all deteriorated in the last ten or fifteen years as a result of dictatorship.<br/><br/>He has an extraordinarily clear prevision of the spy-haunted “police State”, with its endless heresy-hunts and treason trials, all really designed to neutralize popular discontent by changing it into war hysteria.<br/><br/><br/>If one is capable of intellectual detachment, one can PERCEIVE merit in a writer whom one deeply disagrees with, but ENJOYMENT is a different matter. Supposing that there is such a thing as good or bad art, then the goodness or badness must reside in the work of art itself — not independently of the observer, indeed, but independently of the mood of the observer. In one sense, therefore, it cannot be true that a poem is good on Monday and bad on Tuesday. But if one judges the poem by the appreciation it arouses, then it can certainly be true, because appreciation, or enjoyment, is a subjective condition which cannot be commanded.<br/><br/><br/>In Communist literature the attack on intellectual liberty is usually masked by oratory about “petty-bourgeois individualism”, “the illusions of nineteenth-century liberalism”, etc., and backed up by words of abuse such as “romantic” and “sentimental”, which, since they do not have any agreed meaning, are difficult to answer. In this way the controversy is maneuvered away from its real issue.<br/><br/>From the totalitarian point of view history is something to be created rather than learned. A totalitarian state is in effect a theocracy, and its ruling caste, in order to keep its position, has to be thought of as infallible. But since, in practice, no one is infallible, it is frequently necessary to rearrange past events in order to show that this or that mistake was not made, or that this or that imaginary triumph actually happened. Then again, every major change in policy demands a corresponding change of doctrine and a revelation of prominent historical figures.<br/><br/>There is no such thing as a genuinely non-political literature, and least of all in an age like our own, when fears, hatreds, and loyalties of a directly political kind are near to the surface of everyone’s consciousness. Even a single taboo can have an all-round crippling effect upon the mind, because there is always the danger that any thought which is freely followed up may lead to the forbidden thought. It follows that the atmosphere of totalitarianism is deadly to any kind of prose writer, though a poet, at any rate a lyric poet, might possibly find it breathable. And in any totalitarian society that survives for more than a couple of generations, it is probable that prose literature, of the kind that has existed during the past four hundred years, must actually come to an end. Literature has sometimes<br/><br/>Some, at least, of the English scientists who speak so enthusiastically of the opportunities to be enjoyed by scientists in Russia are capable of understanding this. But their reflection appears to be: “Writers are persecuted in Russia. So what? I am not a writer.” They do not see that any attack on intellectual liberty, and on the concept of objective truth, threatens in the long run every department of thought.<br/><br/>All writers are vain, selfish, and lazy, and at the very bottom of their motives there lies a mystery. Writing a book is a horrible, exhausting struggle, like a long bout of some painful illness. One would never undertake such a thing if one were not driven on by some demon whom one can neither resist nor understand.<br/><br/>One’s real reaction to a book, when one has a reaction at all, is usually “I like this book” or “I don’t like it”, and what follows is a rationalisation. But “I like this book” is not, I think, a non-literary reaction; the non-literary reaction is “This book is on my side, and therefore I must discover merits in it”.<br/><br/>To accept an orthodoxy is always to inherit unresolved contradictions. Take for instance the fact that all sensitive people are revolted by industrialism and its products, and yet are aware that the conquest of poverty and the emancipation of the working class demand not less industrialisation, but more and more. Or take the fact that certain jobs are absolutely necessary and yet are never done except under some kind of coercion. Or take the fact that it is impossible to have a positive foreign policy without having powerful armed forces. One could multiply examples. In every such case there is a conclusion which is perfectly plain but which can only be drawn if one is privately disloyal to the official ideology. The normal response is to push the question, unanswered, into a corner of one’s mind, and then continue repeating contradictory catchwords. One does not have to search far through the reviews and magazines to discover the effects of this kind of thinking.<br/><br/>To yield subjectively, not merely to a party machine, but even to a group ideology, is to destroy yourself as a writer. We feel this dilemma to be a painful one, because we see the need of engaging in politics while also seeing what a dirty, degrading business it is. And most of us still have a lingering belief that every choice, even every political choice, is between good and evil, and that if a thing is necessary it is also right. We should, I think, get rid of this belief, which belongs to the nursery. In politics one can never do more than decide which of two evils is the lesser, and there are some situations from which one can only escape by acting like a devil or a lunatic.<br/><br/>It is difficult to see how Gandhi’s methods could be applied in a country where opponents of the régime disappear in the middle of the night and are never heard of again. Without a free press and the right of assembly, it is impossible not merely to appeal to outside opinion, but to bring a mass movement into being, or even to make your intentions known to your adversary. Is there a Gandhi in Russia at this moment? And if there is, what is he accomplishing?",,,,,,0,,,,,

KG,Paperback,565,2000,1999,2014/10/02,2013/09/30,germany,germany (#5),read,"If you are not German, then there's a good chance you've never heard of Marcel Reich-Ranicki (pronounced Reich like that thing the Nazis tried to build, Ranicki like ""ranitzky""). In Germany, up until his death last year he was <i>the</i> guy for ""German high culture"" - if there was a controversial new German book, at least one TV-station would interview him. The biggest newspapers put him on the cover when he wrote a more important critique (most famously, this cover: <br/><br/><img src=""http://www.zensur-archiv.de/images/7/71/Spiegel34.jpg""><br/><br/>). With a few others he had a huge weekly TV show in which they argued about new and old books. Like all Germans, I grew up with the guy, at my parents' place there's two of the book collections he put out, each collection a case of about 20 big books with the (to Reich-Ranicki) most important German literature. In 1999 he published his autobiography, and it's great!<br/><br/>From now on spoilers.<br/><br/>Roughly split into two parts, the first one being Marcel Reich-Ranicki's youth in Poland and Berlin, then his internment in the Jewish ghetto in Warschau, how he lost his entire family to Treblinka, married his wife in the ghetto (the story of how he met her - wow) how he escaped with tons of luck, was hidden by a Polish worker, until the Soviet army invaded Poland in 1944 and he was free.<br/><br/>The second part of the book is his short work for the Polish government as a kind of Till Eulenspiegel spy who doesn't know anything about his work and receives no orders, then his disenchantment with Communist Poland, his move to Germany and his rise to become the biggest critic of German literature, publishing articles weekly, being in constant contact with all famous writers of Germany after 1945. He never even went to university, apart from high school, he was completely self-taught. Amazing.<br/><br/>The first part should interest everyone, the detached way he writes about the loss of so many people close to him kills you. The second part is probably only of interest to Germans, or those who are into modern German literature. People like Günter Grass, Anna Seghers (great story about Reich-Ranicki realizing that she didn't understand her own work), Wolfgang Koeppen, Golo Mann, Stefan Fest and more make up the bulk of this part (how cool was Wolfgang Koeppen?), and if these names don't tell you anything, then the second part will bore you.<br/><br/>There is however a great, short anecdote in that part in which Joachim Fest invited Albert Speer (""Hitler's architect"" and close associate, free after 15 years of prison) and Reich-Ranicki to the same book release and it's a small miracle Reich-Ranicki didn't murder Speer on the spot. I might have.<br/><br/>Throughout both parts the love for literature and music abounds, full of quotes, so this book is a treat for fans of literature. I read through the 500+ pages in one or two days. Last month a new collection of older essays on German literature was published in Germany, can't wait to read it.<br/><br/>Not recommended for: If you're not into books, you'll probably be bored. But what are you doing on Goodreads then?",,,,,,0,,,,,

Sure, this is just my own made-up theory, but I think that, as a result of all the killings in the world and selfish planet-wrecking that humanity has committed, a deep sense of crisis exists.

There's a woman trying to understand a conspiracy that may not exist in the first place. <br/><br/>There are jokes about the long development time of Daikatana, nitpicky dialogues about random vs. pseudo-random numbers, Ghost In The Shell quotes, murders, a strip-club called ""Joie de Beavre"", a professional Nose (i.e., a private investigator who works only with smells), and of course, nothing is ever really resolved, and paranoia is the basic form of consciousness. <br/><br/>Impressive that Pynchon, who certainly doesn't count as a ""digital native"" - at the time of Bleeding Edge's writing, he was about 75 years old - is the first one who can actually write a good novel about the Internet. Neuromancer hasn't aged well, Ready Player One is more concerned with cramming 80s references, some pretend to be about the Internet but are actually about the thing you watched when Angelina Jolie logged into a server in the movie Hackers (like Mankell's Firewall). When Pynchon mentions Back Orifice and Netbus I get nostalgic for my script kiddie days.<br/><br/>Of course not all references make sense, for example, the Daikatana joke - the game actually was released about a year before the novel takes place. But then again, who wants to know?<br/><br/>Recommended for: Fans of fun, the Internet, post-modern books making fun of post-modern books. Fans of The Crying Of Lot 49, I feel like both books are a bit more ""Pynchon light"", i.e., they are easier to follow.<br/> <br/>Not recommended for: People who need a clean, straight-cut story with all of their story-lines resolved.",,,,,,0,,,,,

There's lots of interesting thoughts here I'll have to digest (e.g., there's a possibility that cyber attacks are ""anti-violence"", in that you can now reach your goals without having to physically harm people; there probably won't be a ""cyber 9/11"" since to be efficient in your attacks, you need to a ton of money, knowledge, and people [whoever made Stuxnet probably had enough money to build a working replica of the target factory], etc.)<br/><br/>As a bonus it contains one of the best write-ups of Stuxnet I've read.<br/><br/>Recommended for: Those interested in the intersection of the Internet and politics",,,,,,0,,,,,

To me, he often writes ""too technical"" since he knows so much about literature and writing that he easily can switch, and try to advance, different writing styles. However, in this ""advancing"" the stories often loose their blood; reading them turns into a non-trivial technical exercise instead of fun.<br/><br/>Having said that, the titular interviews are still really good, mostly because these are pure dialogue without any über-stilted elements. It's a little bit like reading through /r/redpill, except that this one is fiction (and thus allows the horror to be replaced by ""mere"" amusement [haha I wish]). Even the strange logic is there, full of the usual biologisms and false equivalences...<br/><br/>Recommended for: people who're not constantly on the Internet and should learn that hellalotta people are creeps with weird reasoning",,,,,,0,,,,,

Sagan is certainly no poet, the language in this book is concise and to the point - no flowery similes, no poetic parts, it's pure story (and large parts of the story don't even have protagonists, it's just descriptions of what's going on internationally).<br/><br/>Sagan's experience on government bodies is clearly showing in this book, it's surprisingly heavy on international, science and office politics. A bit funny that in this book, the Soviet Union still exists in 1999. <br/><br/>The biggest spot of bother is the ending. It's a weird, vague thing - of course, a human author who tries to describe a species that far surpasses humans in every aspect can only fail. Sagan found a nice way to sneak out of that dilemma, but then he destroys it by having the main character find a message in Pi, just like that? I mean, people have been automatically computing Pi for decades now, it feels illogical that the main character can do that on her own.",,,,,,0,,,,,

That's another amazing thing about these lectures; Borges was already mostly blind, everything he quotes (for some reason in Spanish) is from memory, all years and all facts are from his head, which is why he so often gets students to read longer poems to the class for him.<br/><br/>But, if you're looking for Borges as a builder of mysterious worlds, you won't find him here; these are introductory lectures, there's very little interpretation, more often than not Borges is more concerned with how fun the story is and how beautiful the language sounds than he bothers with explaining, as an example, the political background of why a certain writer wrote this poem. <br/><br/>Sometimes it's strange in that he gets a student to read a poem in English, then summarizes the story in the middle of the poem (remember, the students are young and probably didn't know much English yet), then lets the student read the rest of the poem, and at that point you would have expected Borges to talk some more about what they just read, focus on single elements and interpret them, but he just has the student read the next poem. Another curious thing is the choice of authors by Borges - there's only a single page on Shakespeare, but an entire lecture on Stevenson.<br/><br/>Recommended for: People who are looking for an introduction to English literature, or those who need more books on their to-read shelf<br/><br/>Not recommended for: People who want to see a blind man construct a library containing every possible book",,,,,,0,,,,,

Of course, he can't pass the chance to criticize modern Christianity himself:<br/><br/><blockquote><br/>Christianity long ago shifted from the side of the poor and dispossessed to that of the rich and aggressive. The liberal Establishment really has little to fear from it and everything to gain. For the most part, it has become the creed of the suburban well-to-do, not the astonishing promise offered to the riffraff and undercover anticolonial militants with whom Jesus himself hung out.<br/></blockquote><br/> <br/>Eagleton is a well-read writer full of wit, and it be great to listen to Eagleton speak.<br/><br/>It gets a bit weird once Eagleton goes all ""religion is not the modern problem, capitalism is!!! Now let's all talk about how great socialism is!"", but I think that is to be expected with his writing. It's similar in ""On Evil"" towards the end.<br/><br/>Fun quote:<br/><br/><blockquote><br/>The New Testament is a brutal destroyer of human illusions. If you follow Jesus and don't end up dead, it appears you have some explaining to do.<br/></blockquote><br/><br/>",,,,,,0,,,,,

However, this book is impossible to finish.<br/><br/>The story: A human, after he grew up with the elves, is returned to humankind. Mankind's society is alien to him but lucky for him the Elves taught him magic, for example, he can make people and things vanish with the power of this thoughts.<br/><br/>No wait, that was wrong.<br/><br/>The story: A human, after he grew up with the martians, is returned to humankind. Mankind's society is alien to him but lucky for him the Martians taught him special powers, for example, he can make people and things vanish with the power of this thoughts.<br/><br/>Yes, that's more like it. As you can see, I don't think this book is much science fiction: yes, it has spaceships, but no, it doesn't have the <i>great ideas</i> of science-fiction. All this offers is fantasy's escapism, and Heinlein's crude ideas, his own imitation of science-fiction's <i>ideas</i>.<br/><br/>Oh, the ideas: It seems that every time Heinlein had an idea he had to write an SF-book about the idea, explaining why it's the greatest idea ever and every body should follow it.<br/><br/>Starship Troopers? ""Military dictatorship is the best thing, here's half a book of lectures on the topic with some fight scenes in between.""<br/><br/>The Moon Is A Harsh Mistress? ""Libertarianism is best, here's half a book of lectures with some fight scenes in between.""<br/><br/>And this one, Stranger In A Strange Land? ""Polygamy is best, here's a science-fiction book with the latter half being lectures."" To be precise, this book is more about polygyny, and of course only heterosexual!<br/><br/>The women in this book seem to fail the Bechdel test: one of the main protagonists of this book is female and I swear 99% of her thoughts are either about the Man From Mars or about her fiancee. She doesn't seem to have her own motivations, which goes for the other female characters, as well.<br/><br/>And then the writing and plotting - Heinlein seems to be the king of the overpowered Deus Ex Machina, having the Man From Mars always learn new magic tricks when the situation calls for it. The protagonists always have the upper hand, they're never truly in danger. Are they being attacked? Shazam, The Man Form Mars can ""wish"" people away. Is the Man From Mars stuck somewhere? Abracadabra, he can leave his body and, I don't know, ""walk on the astral plane""? That's how Doctor Strange does it. The Moon Is A Harsh Mistress does this as well, by the way - the protagonists have that massively overpowered, invincible AI on their side. In gaming terms: Heinlein is the king of buffing.<br/><br/>So yeah, I can't understand how and why people love Heinlein so much - I guess its an overhang from their childhoods (which also explains why everybody loves the infantile Enders Game so much).<br/><br/>tl;dr avoid!",,,,,,0,,,,,

If you need information on him, here's an excerpt from Penn & Teller, including a short interview with Borlaug: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cEBtO25xW-o (NSFW language). In a nutshell, he developed wheat-varieties with extremely high yield, raised Mexico from a poor wheat-importing country to a wheat-exporting country, and prevented famines in India, Pakistan and China.<br/> <br/>Makes for some interesting thoughts on the current GMO-debate (did you know hybrid seeds in the 1930s were not allowed to be re-sold?), mostly because people are now acting the same way they did towards Borlaug's hybrid seeds in the 60s (""it's unnatural"", ""we're too dependent on modern methods"", ""traditional plants go into extinction"" etc.). Especially in the beginning is the writing a bit weird (Quote: ""Contemplating those events upstairs was super scary""), thus the 4 stars.<br/><br/>It's also interesting that Borlaug was able to give seeds of new hybrids away basically for free since he was funded mostly by the Rockefeller Foundation. Good to know that the Foundation is involved in the development of Golden Rice (which is available for free too for developing countries). <br/><br/>Plus it's only $3 on Kindle, so there's that.<br/><br/>Recommended for: Anyone who needs some inspiration on what one person can achieve in their life.",,,,,,0,,,,,

Only in the last ~10% of the book does the story pick up and things actually happen, before that it's just ""and then the party had to go over there because that's where I, Larry, imagined that other cool thing I wanted to describe"".<br/><br/>I've read that this book is ""hard sci-fi"", as in, ""the things happening in this book are based on valid science"". This is only true for parts of the book, mainly the descriptions and basics of the ringworld. The biology, on the other hand, is absolutely bonkers. Not only does Riven describe natural selection as ""survival of the strongest"" [2], you also (Spoiler!) have a race breeding humans for <i>luck</i>, and the description of why this works boils down to ""fate"" (as in: ""her luck wanted her to be stranded here""). <br/><br/>And just like Star Trek the aliens are not very imaginative either - here again the entire species has just one culture, just one language, just one ""look"". If we ever meet aliens that will be far from the truth (consider us humans - you drive for 1 hour in Europe and you already meet a different culture, language etc.).<br/><br/>2 stars, but only because of the ringworld.<br/><br/>Recommended for: fans of science-fiction.

In reality, natural selection is about ""survival of the fittest"" in which ""fitness"" does not mean strength, but reproductive success. Consider two brothers: One is relatively weak but sexually mature at age 10, the other one is stronger but needs more time to sexually mature since his body had to invest resources into strength, let's say he matures by 15. Both die at 20. Who can have more children? <br/><br/>",,,,,,0,,,,,

In this case of Mullis' autobiography, or rather loose collection of essays, I wanted to do exactly that about 5 times - it has been a long time since I've been this physically angry at a book.<br/><br/>The first quarter of the book is alright - he details how he perfected PCR, how he got the Nobel Prize for that, etc. The one thing  that starts to annoy is his constant drive to portray himself as such an unconventional person - ""Hey everybody, I go to strip-clubs! I'm OK with drugs! I was totally spontaneous and cool when I met the wife of the Japanese tenno![1]"" <br/><br/>You just expect at some point to read ""hi every1 im new!!!!!!! holds up spork my name is kary but u can call me t3h PeNgU1N oF d00m!!!!!!!! lol…as u can see im very random!!!!"" etc. pp.<br/><br/>Some of the early chapters are interesting, for example, when he tries to explain the scientific method. Why he then goes and throws everything out of the window is beyond me - I think it's because he loves being in a position opposite to the mainstream, even if that means distorting and twisting the truth until it becomes a lie.<br/><br/>First, the chapter about his belief in astrology - his evidence that it exists: 3 people guessed his star-sign. Also, a program used the constellation of planets at his birth to describe his character, and I quote: ""Most of the things that the fifty-page document said about me were correct. But some of them were entirely wrong."" (p. 118). Guess what, that's how horoscopes are written! Make them so vague and general that ""most of the things"" are correct! It doesn't take a scientist to notice that, yet Mullis constantly assures us that he's a scientist. Literally: ""I am a scientist"", at least 3 or 4 times in the book.<br/><br/>Then it gets worse and he ""goes full retard"" (Tropic Thunder, 2008), in his views on global warming: ""What is the trouble with something being out of balance if the natural state of that thing is change?"" (p94).  He then goes on:  ""The concept that human beings are capable of causing the planet to overheat or lose its ozone seems about as ridiculous as blaming the Magdalenian paintings for the last ice age"" (p 96). That's his entire rhetoric - he doesn't cite any proof to the contrary, he just does his impression of Rush Limbaugh. That's it!<br/><br/>We humans can and have changed this planet massively, starting with ""small things"" like the artificial Suez Canal, to changing the entire picture of earth at night. We got enough weapons to irradiate and destroy the surface of the earth. And of course the state of earth is change, the problem we humans might get is that this change might wipe us out. He conveniently doesn't mention this - it doesn't fit his story.<br/><br/>The chapter that made me truly angry is the one where he starts to deny the HIV->AIDS causality, and that's when he gets so self-satisfied and the smugness just oozes out of the pages, into your lap, forcing you to take a shower. He says that the presence of HIV-antibodies shows that HIV has been defeated: ""Antibodies signaled that the virus had been defeated. The patient had saved himself."" (p 139). That's like saying that the presence of soldiers shows that there is no war. <br/><br/>This shows that he either doesn't know a thing about the human immune system or he outright lies to save his worldview, I don't know if Wikipedia was very big in 1998, but a look into an encyclopedia could have certainly helped him. And then he goes in and does these absolutely dirty tricks: ""They didn't show that everybody with the antibodies had the disease. In fact, they found some healthy people with antibodies."" (p 139). That is so dishonest that I'm getting angry again just typing this - it takes <i>time</i> for the symptoms of a disease to develop [2]. <br/><br/>He goes into his descriptions of some of the major players of the early HIV ""controversy"", notably Gallo and Duesberg. He uses language again to make one look good and one look bad: ""In spite of his lack of luster as a scientist, Gallo had worked his way up in the power structure. Peter Duesberg, despite his brilliance, worked his way down"" (p 142). Peter Duesberg is one of the biggest douchebags in recent history, and one of the first HIV-denialists. He used to be the editor at PNAS and used that status to circumvent peer-review for one of his denialist articles, something which Muller describes this way: ""Duesberg pointed out wisely from the sidelines in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Science that there was no good evidence implicating the new virus."" (p 143). He again conveniently doesn't mention that Duesberg used his (former) status to get his article into PNAS. He also ignores the HIV-AIDS evidence that was already available in 1998, most disingenuous by saying that ""no-one had proven that HIV causes AIDS"". The problem with proving that is that you have to literally infect a human with HIV, something which no ethics committee in the world will approve. But there are some cases from before the publication of this book which Mullis could have had a look at.<br/><br/>There's the Florida dentist case from 1990, in which a dentist unknowingly infected some of his patients, who were all tested positive for HIV and later died of AIDS, same as the dentist, Wikipedia has an overview: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kimberly_Bergalis This case was the first case in which someone proved that HIV causes AIDS, something which Mullis conveniently forgets. That was 8 years before this book! Another big case was when three lab workers got infected with HIV and developed AIDS, that was in 1997, maybe too close to the publication of this book (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9045880). There's a mountain of evidence for the causality HIV->AIDS, but Mullis always pretends as if he's the lone warrior showing the world that ""the big pharma-companies"" just want to make money with the disease of others. See here for evidence: http://www.niaid.nih.gov/topics/HIVAIDS/Understanding/howHIVCausesAIDS/Pages/HIVcausesAIDS.aspx<br/> <br/>By the way: after the publication of this book, Duesberg became a member of the advisory panel to Thabo Mbeki in South Africa, and his denialism prevented the use of antiretroviral drugs, one of the main reasons why AIDS spread so much leading to literally hundreds of thousands who died of AIDS in South Africa. That man has <i>a lot</i> of blood on his hand! (Check Wikipedia: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Duesberg)<br/><br/>And then, the prime piece, the one that made me throw my Kindle across the room, the most disgusting sentence I've read all year: ""If a person has three hundred sexual contact a year - with people who themselves are having three hundred contacts a year - that's ninety thousand times more opportunity for infections than a person involved in an exclusive relationship"". (p 146) YES IT'S THEIR OWN FAULT THAT THEY HAVE AIDS. THESE DISGUSTING PIGS AND THEIR FILTHY POLYGAMY!! [3] LET'S ALL SHAME MORE VICTIMS. Edit: According to the WHO, 2% of the 8 million children who die per year die because of AIDS. Did these have too much sex too? (Source: http://www.who.int/pmnch/media/press_materials/fs/fs_mdg4_childmortality/en/index.html)<br/><br/>Does he cite peer-reviewed publications for any of his viewpoints? In one chapter he makes fun of a nutritionist for not citing any sources in her ""crusade"" against margarine, and writes that you should always cite sources. Yet there <i>isn't a single paper cited</i> in this book, a thing you would think a scientist would do.<br/><br/><br/>Of course, there are the other crazy things [4] I don't want to go into because to him, they happened, and I can't criticize that. There's a lot more going on in this book that for the purpose of my sanity I will now forget so I can't write about it here.<br/><br/>The only thing you'll learn in this book is that you shouldn't trust people just because they got a prize, even if it's the Nobel Prize. <br/><br/>[1] Apparently the official title is ""chief wife""? http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emperor_of_Japan<br/><br/>[2] especially in HIV that can take up to 3 months, in some cases several years: http://aids.gov/hiv-aids-basics/hiv-aids-101/signs-and-symptoms/<br/><br/>[3] capslock is cruise control for rage<br/><br/>[4] Glowing raccoons abducting him over night. Someone saving him from a laughing gas overdose via astral travelling. His telepathy with a friend. That said friend's face morphing into other faces, even though Mullis was sober. etc.<br/>",,,,,,0,,,,,

Eagleton is a literary theorist and a Marxist and it clearly shows. For him, evil is caused by institutions that make normally ""ok"" people do evil things. He doesn't really support this with studies or any numbers, he rather shows characters from literature as examples for his conclusions, or points to the Nazis. Whether you like that or not is up to you, I think ""hard"" scientists will be annoyed[1]. His writing, however, is beautiful and so <i>British</i>:<br/><br/><blockquote><br/>Perhaps children murder each other all the time and are simply keeping quiet about it [...]. Perhaps this is because we are ready to believe all kinds of sinister things about children, since they seem like a halfalien race in our midst.

For champions of this viewpoint, the only solution to terrorist violence is more violence. More violence then breeds more terror, which in turn puts more blameless lives at risk. The result of defining terrorism as evil is to exacerbate the problem; and to make the problem worse is to be complicit, however unwittingly, in the very barbarism you condemn.<br/></blockquote><br/><br/><br/>[1] I personally would have at least included the case-study of the murdering necrophiliac homosexual duck to show that ""evil"" in the form of senseless violence exists in nature too: C.W.

Sometimes, entire pages seem to have been machine-translated from German, to which Feyerabend added Greek and Latin quotes, and cites ten different philosophers and forgotten authors to make the confusion complete. I had to look up quite a few English words (incommensurable, counter-inductive, etc.). But then suddenly, the next 5 pages are crystal clear and genius! <br/><br/>To summarize his points: Scientific conduct and progress is much more chaotic and ""law-less"" than proponents and practitioners of science realize. He makes his point by showing how Galileo didn't win Europe over to Copernicanism by showing a theory that explained reality ""better"" (as one would assume), Galileo won everyone over by inventing a few tools, hiding a few inconvenient datapoints, being a good propagandist, and a lot of trickery.<br/><br/>For me as a scientist reading Against Method is freeing. There is a break in between how we do science and how we present it to the public - for example, the structure of a scientific publiction has absolutely nothing to do with how the actual results were obtained. In my case with bioinformatics, I start to play around with data, and walk down 500 paths of which 499 don't work. I get some interesting results, and try to make sense of them by looking through the literature, and I finally find some biological phenomenon that might fit. Using that phenomenon as a start, I think how I can prove or disprove it - find one way to prove it - and write the paper. This has nothing to do with the scientific method of hypothesis -> prediction -> testing with data, yet the publication I write follows this structure (I also do not list the 499 things I tried, thereby ""inventing"" a story that is cleaner than reality). <a href=""http://www.phdcomics.com/comics/archive.php?comicid=761"">PHDComics had this fitting comic a few years ago</a>.<br/><br/>Feyerabend correctly sees that stringent application of the ""rules"" of science would make science impossible. For example, if falsification were to be applied stringently we simply couldn't have bioinformatics. Play around with one of the settings in your genome assembler, and you get a slightly different genome - which one is the correct one? If I computationally predict genes in a genome, I get around 400,000 genes. Which ones do really exist? <br/><br/>There are surely ways to falsify this, but the technology does not exist (or it's a tedious, expensive and literally life-consuming work). As long as the technology does not exist, we proceed and publish: ""anything goes"". This makes science much more a field of play than people realize. Schools do not teach this: according to what I learned in high school about science, I should be much more stuffy and strict. Yet a large part of my work is playing around in an R console, looking for fun things, making pretty pictures, and drinking free coffee.<br/><br/>Where I don't agree with Feyerabend in the slightest is his demand to split science from politics - I can understand where he's coming from, I guess up until the 80s the results of science where set in stone. What the scientist said was ""true"", to the detriment of science itself; Feyerabend says that there are other systems alternative to science that are as good as, or even ""better"" than ""Western science"" - he makes the case for traditional Chinese science & medicine, which by now is known to be mostly Placebo effect. I can't agree with him at all. The split of science and politics has (partially?) caused the mess we're in now.<br/><br/>Maybe by now, statistics has done the job Feyerabend wanted other systems to do. The introduction of rigid tests, the spreading awareness of problems like the multiple comparisons problem, too small sample sizes and more, the availability of online anonymous comments etc., has helped to ""dethrone"" scientific results. <br/><br/>I also can understand why scientists rarely read philosopy of science. Large parts of this book serve as counter-arguments to Popper and Lakatos, I rarely understood anything there, since I've read very little philosophy of science.. Plus I, like most scientists, don't understand Latin or Greek.<br/><br/>Recommended for: Practitioners and ""fans"" of science, it's eye-opening.<br/>",,,,,,0,,,,,

Since then, I've jumped through most of the hoops society has laid out for budding scientists, and at some point in the next 2 years I should be allowed to call myself a ""Doctor of Philosophy"" or something like that (""burger flipper""?). It has come obvious to me that there's a ton of problems in scientific research, in the scientific community, and in the way research is conducted. It's also very funny to see that a lot of these problems have already been described in this book from 27 years ago. <br/><br/>Basically, it's a collection of essays in the style of Marxist dialectics, i.e., a way of thinking that tries to incorporate entire systems instead of first trying to split a system into its parts and then analyzing these (the Cartesian approach). I'm pretty sure Dialectics has been re-invented as Systems Thinking in recent years by writers like Donna Meadows, even the way the graphs work is mostly identical.<br/><br/>Some interesting points, in no particular order:<br/>- Evolutionary research tries to see the organism as the outcome of evolution, while Levis/Lewontin try to show that organisms also shape their own evolution (for starters, all species shape their environments, starting from their droppings to more complicated things like building nests/burrrows/dams/houses, and much much more).<br/>- Gene/phenotype studies usually model the interaction between both as a one-way, one-to-one interaction, at one point in time, while there's a world outside this small scale which easily falsifies any results. Much of this is currently repeated in criticisms of Genome-wide association studies (GWAS).<br/>- Evolution as a theory is a product of the society it was invented in. It couldn't have been proposed in a stale, ""God-given"" medieval society.<br/>- I didn't realize before how much of Darwin's thinking was shaped by Malthus.<br/>- The Essay on Lysenkoism has some weird points, like that table showing that during the rise and acceptance of Lysenkoism in the Soviet Union, yield grew and was a bit higher than in the US, and that's taken as a minor defense of Lysenkoism. However, just because yield grew doesn't mean that Lysenkoism was good - there could have been millions of reasons why that happened.<br/>- Not sure why the essay on health in the Latin American community is there; it's way too specialized to be of any interest<br/>- I'm pretty sure that each essay is a hidden angry rant about a recent publication, but since these essays are all fairly old (end 70s to mid 80s) I don't know the publication in question.<br/>- If you're a biologist, skip the first two essays, these are basically modified long dictionary entries showing the current state of evolution and biology. There's a lot in there you've heard before.<br/>- ""The Commodization of Science"" is awesome, a critique of (Western) science as a tool of capitalist expansion, def. recommended (you don't have to agree)<br/><br/>Of course, one can criticize Dialectic approaches as a bit far-strung - it's complicated enough to just look at a one-to-one interaction at one point in time, and success in this can already take a long time (easily more than a normal PhD takes). Analyzing the entire system at once makes things only ""worse"", so to speak. The statistical tools we now (2013) have developed for these ""simple"" interactions are already so complicated that I shudder to think what ""proper"" modelling of a complex system needs.<br/><br/>On the writing: Levins/Lewontin seem to be big fans of the needlessly endless sentence. Definitely no ""pop science"" material!<br/><br/>Anyway, if you're a biologist and you want a very different view on your science, go for it. Similar goes for the interested layman. If, however, you're looking for a fun book you can read on your commute, stay away, for that it's too dry. ",,,,,,0,,,,,

Along the way he learns the memory tricks that are mostly based on the Greeks' work but are still widely in use today, and uses the opportunity to write about the history of memory, some extremely interesting edge cases (like the guy who inspired Rainman), some of the science behind remembering, how these techniques are having a small renaissance in teaching, and why it is that we can remember some things better than others (for example, spatial memories are easier and faster to remember than numbers). You'll learn that memory champions are not hyper-intelligent <i>savants</i>, but are just people who are well-trained in a specific set of tricks, similar to good magicians (a comparison Foer repeats at least 3 times).<br/><br/>Of course, reading this book won't turn you into a all-remembering memory beast, for these tricks require too much initial work - for example, to remember a deck of cards you first have to remember a vibrant (if possible raunchy) image to connect the card to, so you don't have to remember the card itself, only the image. Coming up with these images in the first place, and subsequently learning them for an entire deck of cards, already takes several days to weeks. And then you're in possession of one of the more useless tricks in the world, congratulations.<br/><br/>And of course, there's one small story at the end to prove that when you're the memory champion you don't have to have a good memory: When Foer returns from the US championship, he drives his car to a restaurant to have dinner with friends. Later he returns home by tram, only to realize at home that he forgot he had a car.<br/><br/>Recommended for: People who always wondered what it would be like to know more than 3 digits of Pi.

The background: Lewis met Joy Davidman in life after she came to the UK to separate from her alcoholic/abusive husband. They became friends (""For Jack the attraction was at first undoubtedly intellectual. Joy was the only woman whom he had met ... who had a brain which matched his own in suppleness, in width of interest, and in analytical grasp, and above all in humour and a sense of fun.""), and, after she was diagnosed with terminal cancer, they married in 1956. After a brief relapse she died in 1960. <br/><br/>This very short book is Lewis' way of trying to come to terms with his grief - it's painfully and brutally honest with himself and his confusion about his beliefs. He tries to understand his grief, he tries to understand to position the grief with his beliefs, and eventually he slightly comes to terms with it.<br/><br/><blockquote><br/>The conclusion I dread is not 'So there's no God after all,' but 'So this is what God's really like. Deceive yourself no longer.'<br/></blockquote><br/><br/>or this one:<br/><br/><blockquote><br/>But go to Him when your need is desperate, when all other help is vain, and what do you find? A door slammed into your face, and a sound of bolting and double bolting on the inside.<br/></blockquote><br/><br/>When he remembers her and tries to explain the amount of grief he's suffering and tries to come to terms with his grief, that's when <i>someone's</i> cutting onions around you:<br/><br/><blockquote><br/>Her absence is no more emphatic in those places than anywhere else. It's not local at all. I suppose that if one were forbidden all salt one wouldn't notice much more in any one food than in another. Eating in general would be different, every day, at every meal. It is like that. The act of living is different all through. Her absence is like the sky, spread over everything.<br/></blockquote><br/><br/>or <br/><br/><blockquote><br/>I have always been able to pray for the other dead, and I still do, with some confidence. But when I try to pray for H., I halt.<br/></blockquote><br/><br/>or <br/><br/><blockquote><br/>Reality, looked at steadily, is unbearable.<br/></blockquote><br/><br/>It's one of the saddest books I've ever read, since it's absolute naked truth.<br/><br/>Recommended for: people who have lost someone.<br/><br/>Not recommended for: Invincible heartless space robots with rockets for feelings",,,,,,0,,,,,

The only qualm I have is that the author, Frank Brady, has a personal connection to Fischer from Fischer's late childhood on and was deeply impressed by Fischer. <br/><br/>As such, Brady is constantly trying to improve Fischer's image and sometimes he's just trying too hard - for example, in the match Reshevsky v. Fischer (the ""Match of the Century""). Due to one of the sponsors of the match having different obligations the organizers moved the start of the match a couple of hours earlier, and Fischer just wouldn't have that. He simply didn't show up to the game and thus lost it. How does Brady describe it?<br/><br/><blockquote><br/>... the ""Match of the Century"", as it had been billed, was the unfortunate casualty of Bobby's ingrained sleep habits and the long shadow of patronage in chess.<br/></blockquote> (p. 164)<br/><br/>No, it was a casualty of Fischer being an arrogant brat!<br/><br/>Anyway, I'd still recommend it, it shows that a) behind a ""genius"" is a mountain of lonely hard work (I guess ""geniuses"" don't really exist?), and b) it's always entertaining to read about douchebags.<br/><br/>P.S.: There's also an interesting connection to the ongoing Snowden-case: When an elderly Fischer was arrested in Japan for being there illegally (his passport was revoked by the US because Fischer committed the crime of playing in the embargoed communist Yugoslavia about 10 years earlier) Iceland made Fischer an Icelandic citizen so that Japan didn't have to extradite Fischer to the US. I guess this is why so many people look to Iceland to help Snowden? But on the other hand, Fischer had prior connections to Iceland - he was seen as something of a national hero since he held a tournament in Iceland some twenty years earlier, which made Iceland internationally known. Snowden does not have any such connection.",,,,,,0,,,,,

His orders were to cause mayhem until the Japanese army would sent explicit orders or would come to pick him up. That never happened, so he stayed for 30 years until a student found him in 1974.<br/><br/>The book becomes most interesting when he describes his mental acrobatics to keep on fighting - other Japanese often came looking for him, dropped leaflets on the island, called for him via speakers, but he always found some minor mistake or flaw to convince him that these people were impostors sent by the enemy to trap him. Newspapers saying that the war was lost with pictures of Japanese in their cities were obvious fakes - if Japan had lost, all Japanese people, including children and women, would have died fighting! It didn't really help either that the Philippine army used the island to train bombing runs (<i>genius</i> idea - train where you know that there are still guerillas hiding) - what would you think if you were stuck in an imagined war, but the planes dropping bombs were real? <br/><br/>He never got the official order to stand down, so he never stopped fighting, which he did by terrorizing the poor islanders, burning their rice, shooting at them, stealing from them.<br/><br/>Sadly, the autobiography is slightly insincere. Onoda describes shooting in the general direction of people and never mentions whether he actually hit someone, but <a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hiroo_Onoda'>Wikipedia</a> says he killed several islanders.<br/><br/>Onoda died just 5 months ago. This book seems to have been forgotten since it came out in the 70s - I got it for a dollar at the Lifeline bookfest.<br/><br/>Recommended for: 1) People who are into survivor manuals. Want to know how to store ammunition in the jungle? Collect the bullets in a glass bottle, put coconut oil on the bullet to prevent rusting, close the bottle with a steel cap to prevent rats from eating the coconut oil! <i>You're welcome!</i> (The book has helpful drawings too)<br/>2) People interested in reading about how your psychology can bend your reality<br/>",,,,,,0,,,,,

It's all about Campbell's lifework, which was to compare different mythologies of different cultures and continents and find all the overlapping tropes - and there's lots to be found.<br/><br/>This book shines when Campbell starts to tell all these stories from Native Americans, Inuit, Hindus and Buddhists and shows how they share common motifs and how they are essentially just one big story. It's also great when he criticizes Christianity:<br/><br/><blockquote>Moyers: In the Christian story the serpent is the seducer.<br/><br/>Campbell: That amounts to a refusal to affirm life.</blockquote><br/><br/>I would've given it five stars were it not for Campbell continuously accepting stories as fact, for example:<br/><br/><blockquote>There's a Czechoslovakian psychiatrist, Stanislav Grof, now living in California, who for years treated people with LSD. And he found that some of them re-experienced birth [...]. Isn't it amazing that this repeats just what the myth says?</blockquote><br/><br/>Now Campbell hints here that this is an event re-experiencing something that actually happens, when in reality, it might just have been the drug, no experience necessary. He likes to do this - he often goes out on a leg and states things he can't prove. My biggest peeve is with his central statement of ""Follow your bliss"" - that there's something roughly akin to destiny that is manifested in the things you like. So to be happy you follow that path of your preferences and that is the only way. It's a bit of an unfair thing - if your circumstances prohibit you from following bliss, what then?<br/><br/>He's a bit unfair in other parts, too:<br/><blockquote>Freud tells us to blame our parents for all the shortcomings of our life, and Marx tells us to blame the upper class of our society. But the only one to blame is oneself. That's the helpful thing about the Indian idea of karma. Your life is the fruit of your own doing. You have no one to blame but yourself.</blockquote> - says the Upper Middle Class white guy who could afford to go to university.<br/><br/>Nonetheless, I learned a lot about myths and it was a pleasure reading. It's great when he compares the motifs in Star Wars 4-6 to mythological motifs - and they constantly come back to it! He would've hated Episode 1.<br/><br/>Recommended for: People who get stuck browsing TVTropes.<br/><br/>Not recommended for: People not interested in the fabrics of society",,,,,,0,,,,,

When there is a quote from an political opponent or from a newspaper, it's about Lincoln. In a way, that's good - I can't remember more than five names at once, anyway.<br/><br/>It's a relatively thick, very detailed book, but it's never truly dry and boring - rather, the myriads of quoted contemporary sources (newspaper comments, entries from diaries, letter excerpts) give the book an alive atmosphere.<br/><br/>Did I learn anything? Before this book, I thought the American civil war started because Lincoln outlawed slavery, and then people died, and then slavery was gone. Battles may have involved Velociraptors, and at some point Bill and Ted appeared and stole Lincoln thus probably ending the war.<br/><br/>In reality, the war initially wasn't about the abolishment of slavery, but about the spread of slavery - Lincoln campaigned on a ticket that opposed the spread of slavery, and before he even was inaugurated, the South seceded. Interesting! <br/><br/>There's a lot of inspiring stuff about the moral background and the rather scientific way Lincoln approached each problem - rather than outright stating in his politics that slavery is wrong, he approached the problem from each possible viewpoint to see what each party believes. Some of these examinations have survived in Lincoln's private notes! Very interesting. His humble approach to problems like this, his speeches (that he held mostly himself! No empty congress) makes you feel even more depressed about the current state of democracy.<br/><br/>Two minor problems: You need to be a bit acquainted with American politics and geography to truly understand what's going on, sometimes the movements of armies are described relative to landmarks like certain rivers (and poor German me has to look at a map), sometimes the complications in US lawmaking are not fully described as this book is about Lincoln, not bureaucracy. Also: According to Wikipedia, that awesome story about hookers being named after the Union general Hooker and his party-tent during the war (making the recent affair around Petraeus seem very boring) is likely not true, the word 'hooker' has been used in the same context before the general became famous :(",,,,,,0,,,,,

The book summarizes the beginnings of genetics in the fruitfly, and describes the beginnings of research into the genetic bases for the feeling of time, of sexuality, and for memory in fruitflies. <a href='https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/736269411?book_show_action=false&page=1'>Like Bastian</a> I didn't know anything about Benzer before, so that was an eye-opening experience - and it's cool to read about how all the 'big names' like Watson, Feynman etc. fit into the history of genetics.<br/><br/>Sometimes, the author looses a bit of control over his metaphors and, in my opinion, makes the gene -> phenotype connection too simplistic. All direct quotations of Benzer do it 'right' (if there is such a thing) - Benzer is very cautious in making any comparison between humans and fly behaviour, for example. <br/><br/>Weiner on the other hand uses emotional formulations like 'Biologists who hate sociobiology maintain that we can learn very little about human nature by studying the instincts of other animals' (p 216) - it's not that I <i>hate</i> sociobiology, it's that I think that a lot of people (journalists more than scientists) hype it more than it deserves. Weiner presents some examples of genes in human behaviour that by now are outdated, and he gives them more merit than they deserve, even back then. For example, he links Xq28 stronger to human male homosexuality more than the evidence of the 90s allows for (IMHO). In these parts the book clearly shows its age, biology has become more cautious in the last decade. A very recent example is the discovery of <a href='http://www.nature.com/news/male-researchers-stress-out-rodents-1.15106'>how the mere presence of male researchers influences the behaviour of laboratory mice</a>.<br/><br/>The biggest annoyance to me was the treatment of Lewontin in this book, Weiner presents him as some kind of outdated cold war relic, something like the last Marxist, a unicorn of science - if I remember correctly, he's the only one given negative adjectives in the book ('he's loathed and feared', p 256). I've read other things by Lewontin - he had quite a bit of influence in evolutionary biology that this book omits, he published a bit with Stephen Jay Gould, and his thinking is still influential (and should be more widely spread). I don't think he deserves to be loathed - can someone be loathed who co-invented <a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isadore_Nabi'>Isadore Nabi</a>? [1]<br/><br/>But it's still a good book, just take it with a grain of salt (as <a href='https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/736269411?book_show_action=false&page=1'>Bastian</a> correctly says) - it pulls some of the 'quieter', maybe slightly forgotten characters of science into the foreground.<br/><br/>Recommended for: <br/>- People who want to know what a single person can achieve in their life with inspiration and lots of hard work.<br/>- People interested in the history of science, especially genetics.<br/><br/>[1] Now that I think about it, Isadore Nabi should have gotten <a href='http://www.smbc-comics.com/?id=2853'>the first statue of Darwin looking doubtful</a> for his essay <a href='http://www.autodidactproject.org/other/sn-nabi1.html'>An Evolutionary Interpretation of the English Sonnet</a>.<br/><br/><br/>-----------------------------------------------------------<br/><br/>Update 2014-7-1:<br/><br/>For those interested, one of the chapters describes how the <i>period</i> gene may have something to do with a supposed courtship song in <i>Drosophila</i>: last week research was published that showed this song is just an artefact of data binning. <a href='http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcblog/2014/06/26/can-you-show-us-that-again-please/'>Here's the blog post</a> by the lead author.",,,,,,0,,,,,

I tried to read it in one evening but had to stop at 4am.<br/><br/>It's the story of how one US astronomer turned computer programmer (""astroinformatician""?) found a 75 cents bill for computing time he couldn't make sense of, how he traced that bill, found an intruder on his system, and how it took him months to untangle the web of systems the hacker used to disguise himself.<br/><br/>Stoll had a very interesting scientific way in which he approached the problem of an intruder, which resonated with me strongly: he kept neat lab-books of everything that happened, he thought clearly about each step, and all the little details they used to infer more about the hacker are splendid.<br/><br/>For example, on login the hacker kept on using ""ps -eafg"" to see who was logged in, but ""-f"" was superfluous under Berkeley Unix, which indicated that the hacker was used to AT&T Unix, which  wasn't used on the US West Coast. Therefore it was more likely that the intruder was from the US East Coast, or from abroad.<br/><br/>(Another fun thing about the age of this book - it's clearly written for the layman in 1989, so things that are completely basic today are explained in long terms - ""electronic mail"", for example)<br/><br/>It becomes a fun cat and mouse game - it's always the same intruder (who turned out to be <spoiler>urmel/Markus Hess from Germany</spoiler>), Stoll tried to get the US government involved, but no agency wanted to have anything to do with it - neither the FBI, nor the CIA, nor the NSA had anything to do with computer break-ins, there were no laws yet, nothing (the events in this book happen around 1986-87, I was just a few months old).<br/><br/>It's great fun to read how each step in the plan worked out, how Stoll laid traps, each step in his thinking is detailed (the joys of writing everything down!).<br/><br/>You'll especially love this if you (like me) grew up fascinated with German ""hacker culture"" of the late 80s, early 90s, back when the Chaos Computer Club started to become a name. I got the biggest smile from this little dialogue:<br/><br/><blockquote><br/>""Can you identify who's breaking in?""<br/>""One guy uses the pseudonym Hagbard. Another, Pengo.""<br/></blockquote><br/><br/>I'm pretty sure every German ""computer person"" knows who hagbard was. We've all seen the movie ""23"", and if you haven't, you greatly owe it to yourself, it's one of my favorite German movies (even Robert Anton Wilson, who co-wrote ""Illuminatus!"", has a small part playing himself). It portrays the KGB hacks from hagbard alias Karl Koch and his friends, which is closely connected to the story of this book, but the movie focuses on Koch, while the book focuses on the systems Hess broke in. I guess focusing on Koch made for a more interesting story - he had a relatively large cocaine habit, and he was found burned to death, with no suicide note.<br/><br/>Stoll didn't like the CCC at all - in the book he repeatedly calls them vandals, I guess because back then, it was just a couple of kids messing around, not particularly knowing what they were doing. Nowadays the CCC advises the German government on technical security matters. The Chaos Communication Congress is one of the best and biggest technology conferences in Germany (I'm proud that I once held a little talk there at an ungodly hour together with <a href=""https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5925863-bastian-greshake"">Bastian Greshake</a>/@gedankenstuecke).<br/><br/>Another interesting side-note is that some currently very famous ""computer people"" appear shortly - such as Paul Graham and Robert T. Morris, who have since then founded several companies and are now known for ycombinator, one of the biggest Internet startup seed funding companies (possible more for ycombinator's social news site, <a href=""http://news.ycombinator.com"">Hacker News</a>)<br/><br/>If you want to read a more technical side of this, Stoll first published a paper: <a href=""http://pdf.textfiles.com/academics/wilyhacker.pdf"">Stalking The Wily Hacker</a>.<br/><br/>I wonder how much the events in this book, and the book itself, made Snowden's revelations possible... Would the NSA ever have started to try and control the entire Internet if the Soviet Union had never started to pay hackers for information? <br/><br/>Recommended for: Computer people, those interested in the history of the Internet, those who enjoyed playing Uplink<br/><br/>Not recommended for: People who want to think that the Internet is Facebook",,,,,,0,,,,,

We're often deceived by the simplicity with which System 1 generates an answer, and this book is full of examples on problems arising from our ""lazy"" brains. For example, if we think about a person's qualities System 1 will fill in unknown based on how much we like the person (the Halo effect). Or, during a sale a person makes a unrealistically high starting offer - and even though we dismiss it, our brains base all other thoughts on that ""anchor"" (so it's called the anchoring effect). The book is full of effects like that - effects which might undermine your sense of reality. <br/><br/>Only 40-50% of the book is about the two systems - the rest is about the problems economy has with psychology, in which the author makes fun of economy's unrealistic assumptions that humans are completely rational; and the rest is also about the experiencing and the remembering self - we judge events not really on what we experience, but on what we remember, and there are myriad ways to trick or influence these memories. For example, we can ""taint"" an experience by adding an unpleasant memory to the end of the experience - people automatically judge the full experience worse than before, regardless of everything that precedes the unpleasant memory!<br/><br/>The only problems I had: Kahneman loves to list examples to strengthen his points, so some corners of the book are <i>slow</i>!

It's a long rambling hilarious yarn, there's no overbearing structure, it's just adventure (in the form of pirating and pillaging), followed by hanging around at home for a while, getting drunk and fighting, and then a bit more adventure (but no pillaging, only treasure hunting). I'd wager that on average, someone dies a violent but glorious death every three pages.<br/><br/>It's a world where death isn't particularly scary, as long as others got a good story out of it and you died fighting everything's going to be alright. For example, one guy with long beautiful hair tells the story of how his hair saved his life. He was captured by Norwegians (IIRC) who proceeded to cut off their prisoners heads, he asked whether someone could hold his hair while they cut off his head so it doesn't get soiled with blood, so a Norwegian agrees to hold up his hair. Before the axe comes down, the young man rips his head to the front so that the executioner cuts off the hands of the Norwegian. Now normally that would be an outrage but here, the Norwegians find that ""trick"" so funny, they set the young man free. Who cares if that guy bleeds to death from his stumps! It is a good death.<br/><br/>There's no overarching structure, Orm's encounters become unbelievable at some point (he just runs into old friends in the most faraway corners of the earth), except for Orm's wife Ylva women are mostly spoils of the war, and the second half of the book seriously loses in speed, but it's still a riveting read. It's a lighthearted version of Yoshikawa's Musashi.<br/><br/>Recommended for: Fans of fiction, historical fiction or fun in general",,,,,,0,,,,,

There's mutilation, murder, rape, and all of these on every second page or so.<br/><br/>Set in an unspecified Eastern European state during WW2, this book details how the 10-year old narrator is separated from his parents and has to survive by drifting from tiny village to village (up until this point it's a lot like Ballard's Empire Of The Sun). Since he looks marginally different than others he's not welcome anywhere - most think he's either a Jew or a gypsy.<br/><br/>Interestingly, most of the terror and brutality in this book doesn't come from the war itself, but from the brutal stupidity and superstitions of the villagers. Ironically, the war saves the narrator several times - the Nazi army saves him twice, and the Soviet army heals his broken ribs and gives him a home. At one point, the narrator even sees Jesus in an SS-officer. <br/><br/>It's not really a book about the brutality of war - I'd argue the motif is more like 'those who belong to the group versus the outsider'. The book is full of these manifestations, war is just one manifestation of the theme. Every time the narrator arrives in a new village, he is punished for being an outsider. The holocaust itself is being portrayed as outsiders being punished by the group  (There is one brutal scene which describes how the villagers comb the tracks next to the trains going to the death-camps for anything of value, left by the prisoners; the villagers find an escaped Jewish woman, but the villagers don't help her escape - instead, is subsequently raped and killed. After all, 'she's just a Jew', an outsider). The title-giving Painted Bird is another manifestation of the theme.<br/><br/>Is all the brutality in this book realistic? I'd say yes, judging from what I heard in Germany growing up. But it isn't autobiographical in the strict sense, which seems to have disappointed a lot of people when it came out (and looking over them, some Goodreads reviews still seem to assume that it's autobiographical). If it were strictly a true story then life has more symbolism than I remembered. But that doesn't mean that the book is untrue - all of these things happened.<br/><br/>Recommended for: I'm not sure, honestly.<br/><br/>Not recommended for: Fans of The Book Thief. The squeamish.

It's a massive book trying to summarize the history of knowledge in the 20th century, ending with the rise of ""pop-science-books"" and starting with <br/><br/>The history of the 20th century is not easy and as such, this book is not really ""bed-lecture"" to be easily digested: it's not uncommon that the authors throws ten names at you in one paragraph. Sometimes the ideas are hard to comprehend, but Watson always does a good job to explain everything in laymen's terms, from arts to literature to economics to biology to physics, not much gets left out. But the book keeps on throwing knowledge at you, there is no time wasted - I feel like I stored maybe 1% of the contained knowledge in my brain. <br/><br/>During reading I got the impression that this book focuses mostly on the west's ideas and concepts, and Watson has a few apologetic paragraphs on this in the end, explaining that most of the new concepts that led us into this golden age have indeed developed in the west - I can't really debate him on that. I'm a biologist, and most of our groundbreaking stuff (DNA-helix, PCR, sequencing machines..) have indeed been developed in the west. <br/><br/>I did enjoy some takedowns, for example I've been taught in High School that Freud was mostly right (German classes! A lot of Mann's and other German authors' works draw heavily from Freud's (dream-)symbolism!), but here the evidence to the contrary is presented (Jung was wrong, too). <br/><br/>One of the biggest takeaways I took from this book is how no idea comes about on its own - everything is based on previous ideas, nothing is 100% new.<br/><br/>I would recommend this book to everyone eager to learn where our ""modern"" ideas (or mental models?) come from - definitely not recommended for people who can't concentrate for longer than 5 minutes.",,,,,,0,,,,,

He had little possessions and like a world-citizen he travelled from collaborator to collaborator's couch, staying at each house for a few weeks until another theorem was proven.<br/><br/>Since it's a book about an influential mathematician, pretty much all of the greats of mathematics show up, so the book doubles as a history of modern mathematics, starting with Gauss. If you're into maths some parts of the books might bore you, as the book often sidesteps to explain the background of a particular proof or problem, which you'll probably have heard of already. If you're not into maths, the book might kindle a new love for you, who knows. The author clearly works to make the proofs and conundrums understandable for 'ordinary' people.<br/><br/>Erdős was clearly full of love, always visiting mathematicians' mothers, looking after other peoples' children, never very caring about the order or status of collaborations on papers' authors [1], eschewing wealth and stability for a life of doing what he loved, often donating what money he had to a particular cause he read about in the newspaper, or sending it to struggling mathematicians. In that regard, the book's title isn't <i>that</i> well-chosen, it's probably based on his lack of romantic and sexual love - the book hints towards a severe phimosis or something similar, and a general lack of understanding of women. <br/><br/>The book shines in fun anecdotes about Erdős' life - he buttered his first bread at the ripe old age of 21, he never had a driver's license, he was extremely dependent on his mother, he usually gave away what little money he had, he got lost on a 5-minutes walk, on seeing the solution for the Monty Hall Problem he got angry and didn't understand it for a few days (that made me feel better - that particular solution is so counter-intuitive, I'm still not sure I understood it), he called children epsilons, God the Supreme Fascist, women bosses, he read only one fiction novel in his life (<a href='https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/433567.Flatland'>Flatland</a>, what else?) and more..<br/><br/>Recommended for: People who like interesting people.<br/><br/>Not recommended for: Heartless robots.<br/><br/>[1] I can talk for hours how picky scientists can get about that, entire projects with hundreds of scientists have been severely delayed because some ego insisted on being author Nr. 12 instead of 13.

Since Ramanujan died so young his great contemporary and benefactor G. H. Hardy takes up quite a lot of space in the book; I'd wager 40% of the book focuses more on Hardy than Ramanujan.<br/><br/>The book itself is sometimes too <i>American</i> for my taste - Indian and British life explained with examples from baseball or horse-races. A rather uncomfortable 20 pages or so speculating about Hardy's sexual orientation (who cares?). <br/><br/>It also concentrates on the absolute layman as the audience, so you may be bored when the author starts to explain (for example) factorials. Then again, this is a hard decision to make as the author - do you make it very simple and get a general audience or do you assume some knowledge and alienate many?<br/><br/>Edit 2015-11-18: Looks like a movie based on this book is screening in cinemas now: <a href=""http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0787524/"">IMDB page</a>, <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Man_Who_Knew_Infinity_%28film%29"">Wikipedia</a>.",,,,,,0,,,,,

Post-apocalypse is such a large ""meme"" that post-apoc media has its own list on Wikipedia: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_apocalyptic_and_post-apocalyptic_fiction<br/><br/>This one has an interesting twist in that it's about what happens <i>before</i> a known apocalypse, it's ""pre-apocalyptic"", so to speak. A meteorite is on collision course with earth, people know the exact date the collision is going to occur, but not where it's going to strike exactly. People do however know what's going to happen: a massive explosion causing a tsunami, followed by extreme weather all around the globe (remember the dinosaurs?). This knowledge leads to an interesting society, where the market has collapsed, the price for weapons and canned food has skyrocketed, suicides happen by the minute, society is crumbling but governments still exist.<br/><br/>The novel details the first couple of months of the freshly appointed detective Hank Palace, who found one of the many suicides and thinks that something's a little bit off with it, possibly a murder. I loved his character - a bit dreamy and a bit confused about life in general, if he'd work with me in academia he would perfectly fit in. It's his first murder investigation, and even though people around him disappear to tick off items from their bucketlists, he keeps on going, he always wanted this, but is unsure whether he actually likes it. <br/><br/>The world is well-built, sometimes it's a bit boring, but all in all I'd definitely liked the book - satisfying ending, too. I recently finished Ellis' Gun Machine and The Last Policeman feels much more ""alive"", with characters you'd definitely encounter in any given university-town.<br/><br/>Recommended for: post-apoc fans, people who like crime-novels but are annoyed by the usual setting.<br/><br/>Not recommended for: people who can't read about suicide.",,,,,,0,,,,,

What makes The Sparrow very similar to Silence is that both deal with the hard questions of any religion - if there is a God, how can all of this suffering be possible? If God wants his word be spread, why are his missionaries tortured?<br/><br/>What makes The Sparrow different is that there's a multitude of ""main"" characters, all very different and painstakingly drawn-out, but to the point that their characterization feels forced - they're <i>too</i> novel-like. The structure itself is very much like a novel too - first things build up nicely with some foreshadowing, then everything falls apart, all according to plan.

Especially the second to last chapter feels more like an essay ""pro group selection"" than a chapter in a biography. Mentioning the introduction of myxomatosis to Australia with subsequent loss of lethality as a sign of group selection is weird - the more virulent individuals just died faster, leaving the less virulent individuals alive, you don't need to invoke group selection for that (remember Occam's razor?).<br/><br/>Anyway, highly recommended.",,,,,,0,,,,,

This servers as a very good introduction to Wittgenstein's philosophy - his writing is famously concentrated down to sentences as concise as possible. Here you get explanations from discussions with other philosophers, or from lectures he held.<br/><br/>Some things I noted:<br/><br/>- Many ""famous"" names appear here. Hitler was in a school class with Wittgenstein in Vienna for one year; later on, Popper, Feyerabend, Turing are all discussing/fighting with Wittgenstein. And of course, Wittgenstein's professors at university like Russell or Frege feature prominently, up to their eventual falling-out.  <br/><br/>- Monk manages to show all the times Wittgenstein himself was weirdly naive without any judgment; I can't see how a 50-ish year old Professor of Philosophy can seriously entertain the notion of becoming a ""manual laborer"" in Soviet Russia (""the life of a manual labourer in Russia was the epitome of a life without treacle""). Soviet Russia didn't really want him, quote Monk: ""The one thing that was not in short supply in Soviet Russia was unskilled labour."" However, Monk defends Wittgenstein's remarks to Drury on the eve of Austria's Anschluss to Hitler's Germany as Wittgenstein trying not to worry Drury too much about Wittgenstein's family's situation. I'm not convinced.<br/><br/>- The <i>intense</i> part of Wittgenstein's personality is very well portrayed here. It was apparently very hard to be around him or hold ""small-talk"", and in philosophical discussions his directness was often abrupt to the point of being rude. This is how he wanted to prepare for a wedding:<br/><br/><blockquote><br/>Early in the summer he invited Marguerite to Norway to prepare, as he thought, for their future life together. He intended, however, that they should spend their time separately, each taking advantage of the isolation to engage in serious contemplation, so that they would be spiritually ready for the new life that was to come.<br/></blockquote><br/><br/>As expected, she left after two weeks.<br/><br/>- He wouldn't survive in today's academia - he published little to nothing, most is published posthumously. His teaching was kept ""under wraps"":<br/><br/><blockquote><br/>In order to keep his class down to a size with which he felt comfortable, he did not announce his lectures in the usual way in the <i>Cambridge University Recorder</i>. Instead, John Wisdom, Moore and Braithwaite were asked to tell those students they thought would be interested about the classes. No more than about ten students attended.<br/></blockquote><br/><br/>This is impossible in the age of standardised tests, degrees and the Bologna process.<br/><br/>- Wittgenstein's remarks and Monk's expansion about logic and concepts not being as simple as logicians wanting them to be are eye-opening, recommended reading<br/><br/>- In his remarks about language I'm reminded of Stanislaw Lem's SF:<br/><br/><blockquote><br/>This is because the commonality of experience required to interpret the 'imponderable evidence', the 'subtleties of glance, gesture and tone', will be missing. This idea is summed up in one of Wittgenstein's most striking aphorisms: 'If a lion could talk, we could not understand him.'<br/></blockquote><br/><br/>Most of Lem's SF is about mankind encountering talking lions!<br/><br/>- Wittgenstein's very dry humor is amazing and noted in many episodes like this one:<br/><br/><blockquote><br/>Never having seen Wittgenstein before, he [Mabbott] assumed that this [Wittgenstein] was a student on vacation who did not know this hostel had been given over to those attending the conference. 'I'm afraid there is a gathering of philosophers going on here', he said kindly. Wittgenstein replied darkly: 'I too'.<br/></blockquote><br/>",,,,,,0,,,,,

Because that life was long and complicated the book is with 944 pages big enough to kill a cat, there's enough Japanese names to confuse any non-Japanese person (how many names are there? 500? Even the main guy's name changes three times!) and it's easily the most epic book I've read in the last 10 years (the Internet ruined the word ""epic"", by the way). <br/><br/>The book details the life of Hideyoshi from son of a poor country warrior, to wandering salesman, to personal page, to soldier, to leader of a regiment, to trusted retainer to finally leader of the entire clan. <br/><br/>There's a billion small stories about a country which attitudes are completely alien to me, one example is: Hideyoshi is laying siege to a castle, the enemy's leader doesn't want to give in, Hideyoshi doesn't want to lose thousands of soldiers in storming the castle, so he has a messenger approach the enemy general directly, asking him to commit suicide so that Hideyoshi can take the castle and everyone can safely go home. The general happily agrees (after all, his family and soldiers don't have to die, and he doesn't loose face), he commits ritual suicide on a boat in front of witnesses, everybody is happy and the campaign can continue. It's weird, but interesting.<br/><br/>The style may not be anyone's cup of tea, here's a pretty central paragraph:<br/><br/><blockquote><br/>How boring would be a life lacking the confusions of many digressions or the difficult struggles! How soon would a man grow tired of living if he only walked peacefully along a level path. In the end, a man's life lies in a continuous series of hardships and struggles, and the pleasure of living is not in the short spaces of rest.<br/></blockquote><br/><br/>As you can see, it's a very ""grandiose"" style, but one that I find makes it relatively easy to read, took me about 2 weeks to read the entire book. There are a couple of downsides - I don't think Hideyoshi makes a single mistake in the entire book, which I find hard to believe, and judging from the Wikipedia-article on him it looks like his life isn't that well documented that you can safely say ""these things actually happened"". He's got a couple of mistresses but that's all the ""bad"" there is to him, the rest of the story he's the most perfect human being imaginable, which makes it boring here and there. <br/><br/>One interesting side-effect is that you learn so much about warfare in Japan of the 15th and 16th century that the entire movie ""The Last Samurai"" is revealed as the complete bollocks that it is. <br/><br/>Recommended for:<br/>- fans of historical fiction or ancient Japan, Samurais cutting off each others' heads, Ninjas murdering people, people who like to read about ritual suicide every 50 pages or so, people who like to see long plans work out nicely<br/>- people who like to play Total War: Shogun <br/><br/>Not recommended for:<br/>- people who can't distinguish ""Nobuo"" from ""Nobutada"" or ""Nobunaga"" (these three are different, but related and quite important characters)<br/>",,,,,,0,,,,,

Why this also introduced quasi-post-apocalyptic stretches of land with roving gangs of children in what feels like the rest of the world is apparently left to the reader's imagination.<br/><br/>How society is supposed to progress when no-one has any time to learn is also left to the reader's imagination. <br/><br/>The main guy Logan is a <i>sandman</i> whose sole job is to go around and shoot <i>runners</i>, people whose time has expired and are on the run. He is of course perfectly trained for this task - until his time expires and he runs away. How he goes from ""system-loving exterminator"" to ""freedom-lover"" is also left to the reader's imagination, it just kinda happens from one page to the other. <br/><br/>He is, of course, not alone, being accompanied by a Jessica, whose sole responsibility in the book is to be the mirror for Logan's thoughts. She's not good for anything else, in fact, she's more useless than a stoned teenager in a horror-movie and, as a character, flatter than a square. Her inexplicable uselessness mostly serves to progress the plot. At one point she has to have sex with a bad guy while Logan has to have sex with six women (the entourage of the bad guy). I don't know why that happened.<br/><br/>This book introduces <i>some</i> Sci-Fi ideas, but doesn't follow their train of thought anywhere - the story rather focusses on the flight of the pair (which - spoiler! - at one point falls in love with each other, another thing which is an absolute miracle - it's not like they really ever talk about anything, or interact, or grow as humans), so if you're more into action with plot that has more holes than my teeth this book might be for you, but -<br/><br/>I don't know who might like this book. People who liked the movie and have some nostalgic soft spot? I never saw that movie, can't tell. People who like cheesy terrible books? Go for it! It's quite short (that's good).",,,,,,0,,,,,

The main guy seems to be the proto-Spock - a guy trained in a new science called Nexialism, some kind of ""all-sciences-into-one"" with hints of individualism/libertarianism with a healthy dose of what science-fiction in the 50s was like (electronic telepathy, mind-controlling, funky big machines etc).<br/><br/>Each story is about the crew encountering an unknown, but superior alien organism. The first story is a LOT like the first Alien movie (I think the author sued and got some money), and each time the main guy, thanks to his superior intellect and background, defeats the alien using <i>logic</i> (and his gadgets).

So if you're looking for a manual for life, you might have to look elsewhere (try the Essais! Or maybe Gracian's ""The art of worldly wisdom""?).<br/><br/>This book is a biography of Michel de Montaigne, former mayor of Bordeaux, French statesman and author of the Essais, a ~1300 pages long collection of short and long essays (one might say blog-posts today) on all matters of things, from politics of the time to how to live properly like a stoic, that made him famous in his lifetime in the 16th century and is still famous today. In the Essais Montaigne describes his personal philosophy (without ever calling it so) of a sceptic stoicism (as well as a million other things, from his life to his politics to his sex-life).<br/><br/>At times dry and funny,<br/><br/><blockquote><br/>As the modern critic David Quint has summed it up, Montaigne would probably interpret the message for humanity in Christ's crucifixion as being ""Don't crucify people"".<br/></blockquote><br/><br/>at other times horrifying (for example, descriptions of atrocities of the French protestant/catholic civil wars), this book is a collection of questions and short answers which serve as loose starting-points for certain aspects of Montaigne's life and works. The book likes to follow Montaigne's loosely connected ""rambling"" style (several times it jumps forward to the death of Montaigne, then back to some political aspect of this work, then to developments in modern criticisms of the Essais, then back to descriptions of his wife), quite enjoyable if you're prepared to jump around a bit. <br/><br/>The book itself is written in a very clear, modern style, I can't find any ""stiff"" non-fiction-style, which makes for a very enjoyable read. The short rules of Montaigne on ""How to live"" are explained using parts of his writing and his life, but the focus is clearly on his life - so this book rather serves as an introduction of his life and contemporaries, a great preparation if you're willing to tackle the main-part, the Esssais themselves. <br/><br/>Definitely recommended, for people who like biographies of unusual people, people who want to know where modern scepticism comes from, and those who love the Essais.",,,,,,0,,,,,

The very first essay is on ""nerds"" vs. ""non-nerds"", I'd say, and is mostly based on his own high school time. The gist of it is that nerds in high-school were the most pure beings and the only ""adults"" and oh-so-clear-sighted and just forced to put up with this prison called high-school, and how everybody else was and is just an idiot etc. pp. There's also one extremely strange essay on generating wealth that was just written, I think, because Graham is rich? It's mostly ""Rich people earn so much money because they work hard and generate a lot of wealth"", yeah, we saw in the last financial crisis how much wealth bankers generate.<br/><br/>My advice: Skip the society essays, read the programming essays.",,,,,,0,,,,,

The author instilled the mistakes and successes of his work on the IBM 360 Operating System in the 70s, and most of what he found still applies today. For example, wisdom like: more programmers make a project only late, and if you add programmers to an already late project, results will arrive even later. Have an architect and a manager, hopefully in two different persons. Have version control (since the book is old, it's more of a central repository of printed (!!) books that detail all changes, the outline, the design etc.). There is no silver bullet - software is inherently complex and there will never be a single technology which makes it fast/easy/cheap/error-free.<br/><br/>A large portion of the knowledge contained is more useful large companies or large projects, where you have 100 to a 1000 programmers working at the same time, so for me as a lonely bioinformatician toiling on my own code not everything is applicable. But if I look through failed projects at, for example, Kickstarter, I realize that they often just repeat mistakes people already solved in the 70s. <br/><br/><a href='https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/99038582?book_show_action=true'>This review has a good summary of the main points.</a><br/><br/>I'm giving it 4 stars since some of the examples, discussions and problems are clearly outdated by now.",,,,,,0,,,,,

We are concerned about the extraordinary government intervention in promoting Anzac Day, most of which has occurred without people knowing its true extent. We are also concerned about the misrepresentation and forgetting of our broader history. History runs counter to myth-making.<br/></blockquote><br/><br/>As a German reader living in snake country, Anzac day is a weird thing - could you imagine hundreds of Germans traveling to Poland every year to commemorate the German invasion? Yet Australians do that, ever since the late 90s, when the conservative Howard government (when isn't an Australian government conservative?) decided to move away from the icky Australia Day (a.k.a Invasion Day) and focus more on war commemoration, with all the US-American kitsch it entails (<br/><br/>Thanks to this I've learned a lot about how Anzac day started, and how the young Australia fought strongly about war issues (something which doesn't happen <i>at all</i> nowadays, despite a large involvement in overseas wars), and how organizations such as the RSL fought for pro-patriotism - for the longest time I thought RSLs are a chain of pubs focusing on slot machines (=pokies), it took quite a while until I learned that these are gathering places for veterans (what a strange idea! building a bunch of large gambling pubs for possibly traumatized ex-soldiers) from a huge organization that used to lobby for forced conscription and to have communism outlawed.<br/><br/>Lots of interesting side things (the near-split of Western Australia over war discussions, the facts that Australia had practically no say in WW1, that Gallipolli was an invasion and not some kind of defense of Australia [from what?]), but sometimes too repetitive, not always focused on the message (that's what happens when you have several authors). Interestingly, this book is the first book on history that I've read that extensively cites blogs and Internet comments as sources for the vox populi. These comments help the book to make a good distinction between the terrible and lazy Australian political rhetoric and the feelings of the actual population - there's a large rift in between.<br/><br/><blockquote><br/>As our political leaders increasingly mimic the public performances of American politicians, smiling and waving to the cameras as they pass through the church gates on Sunday morning, one wonders if the Anzac revolution has occurred not because we are a post-Christian society, but because we live in a time of religious revival. Before Anzac, we bow down, we close ranks and we remain silent.<br/></blockquote>",,,,,,0,,,,,

Reading about the omnipotent Gods living in their tech-bubble inside the Culture would become boring very fast.<br/><br/>Why it's boring to read - there's nothing to learn or gain for the reader. There are some thinly veiled allegories on mankind, for example the Azad in the second culture-book, ""Player of Games"" with their useless pride and cruel society. You can find better allegories in other books, for example ""Animal Farm"", ""The Library Of Babel"" or something from Saramago. Go read these books if you want to learn about humanity.<br/><br/>Storywise it's relatively straight-forward in all books - someone from inside the culture (or in close contact to it) is sent out to investigate or help with another culture, which is either very interesting or threatening to start a war. The protagonist is usually accompanied by intelligent technology, which safes him or her from most threatening situations using, basically, magic. Sometimes the machines fail to make the story ""dangerous"", but that's it. The main character then goes and solves the conflict using his/her technological wizardry. That's it.<br/><br/>I still give it 3 stars: if you like escapism and dislike this world you live on, read these books. Great world-building and Banks' imaginative mind paired with his storytelling prowess should guarantee that you're entertained.<br/>If you want to learn anything, don't waste your time.",true,,,,,0,,,,,
