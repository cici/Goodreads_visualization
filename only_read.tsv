And the answer always comes back – they are – and the thought itself is too crazy, too incomprehensible, and I get on with the operation.<br/></blockquote><br/><br/>What an interesting, <i>human</i>, and very honest book - Marsh, nearly at the end of his career as a neurosurgeon, writes one chapter about something in his work that touched him - be it an operation that went wrong, or his fights with the hospital bureaucracy, his lifelong forays as a ""Western"" doctor into the post-Soviet Ukraine, personal anecdotes on having seizures and fear of cancer in the own family, and there's <i>so much regret</i>:<br/><br/><blockquote><br/>Early the next morning I lay in bed thinking about the young woman I had operated on the previous week. She had had a tumour in her spinal cord, between the sixth and seventh cervical vertebrae, and – although I do not know why, since the operation had seemed to proceed uneventfully – she awoke from the operation paralysed down the right side of her body. I had probably tried to take out too much of the tumour. I must have been too sure of myself. I had been insufficiently fearful. But I knew that however bitter my regret, and however well the pineal operation went, nothing I could do would undo the damage that I had done to the young woman.<br/></blockquote><br/><br/>Some minor quibbles are the parts on NHS bureaucracy are probably due to his rose-colored glasses of the past (""in my day we wouldn't have allowed this!"").<br/><br/>If you like thinking about your own demise, like to think about how medical doctors tick inside, or are into neurology, this should be for you. I think I'm getting this as a birthday present for my soon-to-retire-from-medicine father."						0

One of them finds a way to quickly mine Illyrion (very rare) in a most dangerous fashion and assembles a motley crew and tries to mine it. All the while his rival tries to stop him.<br/><br/>On the outside it's a well-known story but there's a lot of ""meta"" in this to make it more interesting, such as Katin's plan to write a novel about their adventure, and how much it resembles the quest for the Holy Grail; there is an interesting beginning of a philosophy of labor which builds up on Marx's theory of alienation (in this case represented by some philosopher from ""our"" future) and ""solves"" it using technology; and some reflections on art. Looking at Delany's life it's like the Mouse and Katlin are both facets of Delany's personality (but I'm just guessing). <br/><br/>The large involvement of reading Tarot cards in this particular society may be a product of the 70s.<br/><br/>Recommended for fans of meta-SF"						0

It's all very ""standard"" fantasy/SF from there - the hero Fenric Jaggar, a true human with pure genes, arrives in the country of his ancestors, the ""true humans"", genetically pure etc. pp. (his father had been exiled due to ""alleged warcrimes"").  <br/><br/>The kingdom is undermined by the Dominators, mind-controlling ""unpure"" monsters, who are apparently a mix of Jews and Communists, who have been created by the atomic bombs. Of course, Jaggar turns out to be the chosen one, descendant of the pure kings, he's the only one who can wield the special weapon and he's the one who saves the kingdom etc. pp.<br/><br/>It all reads like this:<br/><br/><blockquote><br/>His face was set in a steel grimace of determination; in his blue eyes was a fierce and iron ecstasy. For an instant their eyes met and they were united in the comradely communion of battle, transfigured together in a red mist beyond time or fatigue. Through the metal of the tank, the common weapon which they shared, their souls seemed to touch and merge for an instant in the greater communion that was the racial will. All this took place in the blink of an eye; their beings were not for an instant distracted from the sacred task.<br/></blockquote><br/><br/>I tried to read it in an afternoon but it just gets too tiring, and I started to flip pages towards the last third.<br/><br/>Especially  hilarious are the introduction (""About the author"") and the afterword (""Those unfamiliar with the commercial science-fiction genre may be startled to learn that such pathological products are not that uncommon. The literature of science fiction abounds with stories of all-powerful phallic supermen, alien creatures rendered as fecal surrogates, penile totems, vaginal castration symbols (such as the monster with the many sucking mouths filled with razor-sharp teeth in Swastika), subliminally homoerotic or even pederastic relationships, and the like."") I would have preferred to have the novel itself halved and the afterword doubled in length.<br/><br/>It's a fun takedown of 60s/70s ""preachy"" fantasy and SF, like the Gor novels, or even Heinlein. I would pay good money to have Bruno Ganz reprise his role as Adolf Hitler and read a German translation of this, I would die laughing.<br/><br/><a href=""http://www.depauw.edu/sfs/backissues/1/leguin1art.htm"">Here's Ursula K.

The first brother's path takes him to a nondescript war, which reads more like a fever nightmare without sense or purpose. Soldiers march on without sense or purpose, people fall to the side and die, no-one knows what's going on, enemy soldiers are rarely encountered, soldiers are shot from seemingly nowhere, the skies are drenched in red.<br/><br/>He loses his legs in what may or may not be a friendly fire incident, after which he returns home to his family and brother. His shaking implies shell-shock, and he subsequently loses his mind. The other brother is not a soldier (for some reason), his story is about the reactions of society to the war, the stupidity and craziness of the people supporting it, and the madness of it all.<br/><br/>The descriptions of war - trenches, senseless shelling, fields filled with dead and wounded - made me think the author was a veteran of WW1, but The Red Laugh was published in 1904.

The only problem with them is that the book they are reviewing is usually outdated, or even out of print. The <a href=""http://www.nybooks.com/articles/archives/1976/apr/15/the-strange-case-of-the-spotted-mice/"">titular essay</a> is a review of a book on a case of scientific fraud of the 70s (the book, again, is out of print). It surprised me how many similarities there are in this case to the recent acid-bath stem cell case of fraud, and I wonder how much of the psychology Medawar mentioned can be applied in this case, too...<br/><br/>The ones on philosophy of science seem to be almost 100% based on Popper's work, these are usually rejections of inductivism and praise of falsification, there's even a short essay on why historicism is bad. I'm not sure why you should read these - they're more readable introductions to Popper's work, but if you've read Popper (or of Popper) before, you won't find that much new in these essays.<br/><br/>You can clearly see why Gould wrote the introduction for this, this is where Gould's writing is coming from (even though Gould's essay style was much different, more American).<br/><br/>The later essays are more personal, focusing on disease, a few good tips on being in a hospital, (from which I loved this quote:<br/><br/><blockquote><br/>It is a rightly humiliating thought that, in spite of Man's ability to reach the moon, etc., etc., [sic], no one has yet designed a bedpan which is not physiologically inept, uncomfortable, and somewhat obscene.<br/></blockquote><br/><br/>Absolute truth - if you've ever been in a hospital and not allowed to get up, the design of any of these things hasn't changed in more than 50 years! Here's something for your ""disrupting start up""), and on religion.

To her, the Greeks were the first to bring ""light"" into the darkness of a world ruled by darkness and magic, in the form of rational thought. The Greeks were the first to play - she compares them to the Egyptians, to whom life was just suffering. Their statues, their architecture, their poetry and writing was reduced down to the barest possible; if you've said it as precise as possible, then that's enough, no need for repetition or fancy allusions. A few playwrights are given their own chapters, in which they are compared to their ""modern"" partner (if one exists). <br/><br/>To Hamilton, Greeks were the first and the last to be truly in love with knowledge and all possible viewpoints - she gives the example that there were plays making fun of their own side during the war, which received rave reviews and full theaters. Can you imagine the same thing happen in the US nowadays [1]? Of course, it feels like sometimes her image of Greece is <i>too positive</i>, and the darker times of Athens' hubris and fall are often quickly glossed over. Then again, why focus on the ugly when you're writing a love letter?<br/><br/>Recommended for those people who'd like to know why many still see Greek philosophy, thinking and art as important.<br/><br/>[1] Her example is from WW1. But I switched for a modern example (the proof is easier to find: <a href=""http://www.alternet.org/tea-party-and-right/cut-her-head-shocking-death-threats-you-can-receive-mocking-eastwoods-american"">cough, cough</a>). Of course that comparison is unfair - Athens was small and (relatively) homogeneous in thought, the US is a huge country full of different cultures and diametrically opposed political streams."						0

But unlike Jünger, Kyle has a weirdly inconsistent world-view, he sees himself as a patriot who defends his country, not for religious reasons (but then he gets the crusader cross tattooed anyway), yet Iraqis defending their country/way of life are not soldiers, they are ""savages"", ""drugged crazies"" or ""terrorists"", never soldiers.<br/><br/>It's all very American - there's no gray zone, the others are ""evil"", you're the ""good guys"", there is no moral ambiguity, life as an action movie.<br/><br/>It makes little sense.

Each chapter summarises the life of a mathematician (sometimes two, if their lives are intertwined), with about a quarter of each chapter being reserved for details on one or two discoveries.<br/><br/>In tone it reminded be a lot of Russell's History of Western Philosophy - there's the British humor and the strong opinions, some people may be put off by this. It's definitely no unbiased retelling of the history of mathematics (furthermore, about 80 years have passed. Many of these stories may turned out to have been falsehoods by now [and in looking up this book, many of them are, but that doesn't detract from their <i>fun</i>]).<br/>Some quotes to show the humor:<br/><br/><blockquote><br/>As a matter of temperament some find the Laplacian conception of an eternally stable solar system repeating the complicated cycle of its motions time after time for ever and ever as depressing as an endless nightmare. For these there is the recent comfort that the Sun will probably explode some day as a nova. Then stability will cease to trouble us, for we shall all quite suddenly become perfect gases.<br/></blockquote><br/><br/>or<br/><br/><blockquote><br/>Cauchy's life and character affect us like poor Don Quixote's — we sometimes do not know whether to laugh or to cry, and compromise by swearing.<br/></blockquote><br/><br/>or<br/><br/><blockquote><br/>But on the utterly imbecilic advice of his physician he began meddling in politics ""to benefit his nervous system."" If ever a more idiotic prescription was handed out by a doctor to a patient whose complaint he could not diagnose it has yet to be exhumed.<br/></blockquote><br/><br/>Some things I learned:<br/><br/>- many famous mathematicians were ridiculous child prodigies in their youngest ages, Gauss being the most famous example, discovering formulas at the age of 9, finishing <i>Disquisitiones Arithmeticae</i> at the age of 21 (!!!) in Latin (!!!); William Rowan Hamilton spoke 13 languages by the time he was 13 years old (E. T. Bell gets very angry about this ""waste of time"", he could have been doing mathematics!). It may make you look at your own life with a <i>hint</i> of having already wasted it.<br/><br/>- others did terrible in traditional systems - like Poincaré, who nearly failed the mathematical parts of his Bachelor's degree and was only admitted because of his previous mathematical importance<br/><br/>- funding of science changed a lot with the French revolution - before that, good mathematicians got their money from benevolent rulers, after that, they either had to give lessons or were (sometimes poorly) employed by universities<br/><br/>- transfinite numbers are weird<br/><br/>- and much more, it's a long book<br/><br/>The biggest drawback, and here the book shows its age, is the <i>very</i> dry style of the mathematical parts, maybe I'm too spoiled by pop-science writing, maybe it's the age. Sometimes, the mathematics is rather simple and you wonder why the author takes so much time to expand on these points (the age?), sometimes it's so short that you have to go look it up on Wikipedia. These definitely take their time if you want to read them properly.<br/><br/>But then again, to quote the author (on a different occasion):<br/><br/><blockquote><br/>The choice of such phraseology is not merely stereotyped pedantry. There is a reason for its use, and careful writers mean exactly what they say when they assert that “we can find, etc” <i>They mean that they can do what they say</i>.<br/></blockquote><br/><br/>Recommended for: People into mathematics; people who think a book about mathematics is boring (you may want to skip or skim the mathematical parts, but it's your loss); fans of British humor<br/><br/>Not recommended for: People without patience, as it took me a few weeks to read this; People who need the truth and nothing but the boring truth"						0

Some classic horror stories ranging from (to me) absolutely unknown Belgian or Nigerian authors, to well-known ""classics"" like Borges, Akatagawa, Kafka, and a few modern writers like Miéville, King (of course), Barron, etc.<br/><br/>Some of the stories work well as Twilight Zone, X-Files or Outer Limits episodes, and several have become episodes, but these are usually forgettable (who knew that Outer Limits episode with the scientist raising spacebugs that build a statue of the scientist's face was based on a George R. R. Martin story?).<br/><br/>My favorite stories and novellas in this are the dream-like ones, that put a rug under you and take you into someone's dream, you're not sure whether it's a nice dream of a nightmare, and just when you're getting used to it the story slips the rug from underneath you by simply ending.<br/><br/>Two novellas are worthy seeking out on their own: ""Tainaron: Mail From Another City"" by Leena Krohn, a novella in letters from a person (?) who has moved to some kind of city (or giant organism) inhabited by insect-like people, or people turning into insects (?) and writes letters to her home.<br/>""The Other Side Of The Mountain"" by Michel Bernanos is a story of a shipwreck into a different dimension (maybe) in which the world changes all of its new inhabitants physically.<br/><br/>Recommended for: Fans of something different?"						0

Some things that struck me particularly:<br/><br/>1. Since it's set in Victorian England, communication between towns and cities is very poor, especially in the beginning of the invasion, when the next village doesn't know that their neighbors are all dead. That made me think of what would happen today with instant communication around the world.<br/><br/>2. The protagonist is no hero, he's just there as a pure witness. Most current stories focus on the ""one hero who saves the day"", this protagonist is more a bit of a coward (he could have saved the annoying priest, for example).<br/><br/>3. The heatrays used by the aliens are invisible, something which a modern writer would never write! Modern SF requires rays to be visible, even if they can't be in reality. It just has been ingrained in our collective imagination. Other examples of this are gun-silencers that are completely silent, flashbangs that don't burn, sound in space, etc.<br/><br/>4. There are a few things illogical - the ending (or solution) is rather weird, and in its abruptness reminded me a lot of the ending of the movie Signs. <spoiler>You'd think they would have worn closed suits to survive earth's viruses - and how does human blood as their food work? You probably can't survive on alien meat, except if you share common ancestors, which is highly unlikely with Mars</spoiler> Furthermore, aliens seem to favor the UK for some reason (a tradition that has been happily continued in Dr. Who), but that could be just due to the little overview of the protagonist.<br/><br/>Anyway, nice proto-SF, good to see where the genre comes from."						0

He explains it for metabolic networks, for protein interaction networks, and more.<br/><br/>He uses the image of Borges' Library of Babel, except that each book is a station in the library of all possible connected protein interaction networks (most of them make no sense, some of them do), and these books are connected by single changes. Each reader is an individual of a population, and if you take the wrong step (mutation) and get a book without sense, you die.<br/><br/>The interesting thing is that if you map these libraries for the organisms where there's data like <i>E. coli</i> or yeast, you can take random walks through there using programs. And what they found is that you can take very long walks (up to 80% of the library) through the library, ending up in very different networks that still produce the same outcome. That way, a large part of the library, and with that a large part of variation, is explored! Interestingly, you can do the same with human-created logical circuits, and you get very, very similar results. <br/><br/>For biologists reading this book especially the beginning might be slow as he uses many examples from undergrad biology like the lac-operon, Hox genes, and more. You might want to check out his publications instead: http://www.ieu.uzh.ch/wagner/publications.html<br/><br/>Especially ""140. Wagner, A. (2013) Genotype networks and evolutionary innovations in biological systems. In Handbook of Systems Biology. Eds: Walhout, A.J.M., Vidal, M., Dekker, J., Academic Press, London, p 251-264. "" looks good, Figure 13.2 is also in the book. Nice of him to provide reprints for most of his work!<br/><br/>Does this book solve the question of how nature comes up with innovations? It certainly is a great ""viewpoint"" and deserves more thought (from me, too).<br/><br/>Recommended for: Those interested in life who like to see things from a different angle.<br/><br/>P.S.: Looking around a bit for more reviews on the web, it seems there's a quite large group of people who are outraged by Wagner's few quips about creationists. Americans are weird."						0

The later parts are a few collected poems of Herzog, an autobiographical fragment of traveling through Germany, and a few essays on Herzog.<br/><br/>The dialogue goes through Herzog's entire life and work up until ~2013, focusing mostly on his movies, especially his philosophy of his work. What impressed me most about this is how much Herzog is on fire for his work, he never compromises anything, with a certain pride to commit crimes in order to make his movies possible (forging documents, stealing cameras, a few break-ins, planned murders (understandable with Kinsi) etc.). I wish I would burn just half as much as that man.<br/><br/>The dialogue is full of great quotes on the theme Herzog vs. The World full of humor and warmth, here two examples:<br/><br/><blockquote><br/>Parents these days even send their children to the sandpit with a helmet. The whole thing is repulsive. I would never trust in a man who has had multiple helmets by the age of five.<br/></blockquote><br/><br/>or<br/><br/><blockquote><br/>You would get me watching WrestleMania before you could drag me into a theatre. I'm much more comfortable with the vulgarity of that crowd. There is more honesty in WrestleMania's fakery than in traditional theatre.<br/></blockquote><br/><br/>or on one of Herzog's common themes, mankind's relationship with the indifferent universe:<br/><br/><blockquote><br/>The overwhelming quality of the universe is monumental indifference and lack of order. It's a statistical improbability we're even on the plant, this miniscule speck surrounded by a myriad of uninhabitable, hostile and lethal stars that boil in nuclear rage. Look at the solar system from a satellite and see how utterly insignificant Earth looks. The universe couldn't care less about us, and I hope I never have to call upon it for asssistance. <br/></blockquote><br/><br/>The dialogue is filled to the brim with amazing anecdotes, some of which you may have heard already (the shoe-eating, the many quarrels with Klaus Kinski including that one time the local Natives offered to murder Kinski, all the crimes committed to get the movie done...), highly recommended. If you're not a fan of Herzog's movies or you haven't seen them, I'm pretty sure some parts will drag as you won't really know what he's talking about.<br/><br/>Recommended for: Those interested in impressive people, fans of Herzog,<br/><br/>Not recommended for: tax officials						0

It's revealed that these men have huge armies, but it's quickly established that these armies rarely fight - so what's the point in having 99% of mankind keep on producing robots?).<br/><br/>The premise is a bit too black/white for me, too obvious criticisms of a media society, and the story just drags along until it suddenly ends out of the blue without any real solution, as if Dick hit some deadline and just abandoned the story there. The only interesting character is Lantano, but sadly he has very little ""screen time"".<br/><br/>Recommended for: Fans of PKD who desperately <i>need</i> to have read every novel<br/><br/>Not recommended for: The rest"						0

This ""dystopian future without morals or structure but with lots of blood"" seems to have been a big thing in the 90s: see Judge Dredd, RoboCop, Rogue Trooper, (in fact, most of the 2000 AD characters), it's also an aspect in some older Gibson books.<br/><br/>Womack's Dryco novels (and his I think unrelated but IMHO best ""Random Acts Of Senseless Violence"") are set in a very similar world - it's America of the not-so-distant future, society kind of works but has mostly collapsed, mega-corporations run the place more than politicians, and due to various reasons the law isn't exactly enforced, i.e., most of the characters are under threat of death and constantly kill themselves, without anybody blinking an eye. On most pages random bystanders die.<br/><br/>The first one, Ambient, was a bit too much over the top for me (for example, ""board room meetings"" are matches to the death by a companies' champion against the other companies' champions, and the losing company has its CEO's head cut off while the companies' ownership is being transferred to the winner). This third one, Hearthen, is a bit less extreme because it acts as a bit of a prequel - it's set before Dryco became the company running the USA, with some events of the first book (such as the AI, or Ambient's ""big bad guy"") being nicely foreshadowed. Therefore, most events described aren't that extreme as in the first one (but the great Ambients don't feature as much as in the first one).<br/><br/>The basic story is that Dryco is looking for a messiah so it can use him for their company PR, finds one who performs Jesus-like miracles and tries to hire him, he mostly goes along with it (without any real motivation except ""my God(s) told me to""), there's a relatively believable ""good"" female main character, yet the story often just bungles around without really progressing. I guess it's good as a part of the series but doesn't work on its own, yet I liked the ""less extreme""/""more quiet"" aspects of it.<br/><br/>[1] IT HAD A TURBO BUTTON to slow down to 16 Mhz (else Theme Park would run too fast)"						0

While he's on the way to meet a former female colleague he realises that he has been more than blind towards her interest... It's hard to describe how well Ishiguro <i>understates</i> his reactions to her, and it's up to the reader to realise what's going on. It reminded me of (and if you're a man, it will remind you too) of dialogues in your youth like this one:<br/><br/>Her: Sooo (short pause, finger in hair and a twirl) what are you doing this weekend?<br/>You: Hmm not much. Maybe TV?<br/>Her: I don't have much planned either!<br/>You: Huh. Well, um, enjoy, I have to go now.<br/><br/>[exeunt you and your idiocy]<br/><br/>And then 10 years later this memory suddenly hits you out of nowhere and you <i>still</i> have to groan.<br/><br/>Anyway, the book is much more than that - there is some hilarity ensuing from too much Britishness (the 23-year old godson of the manor's lord is to marry soon - the father himself never explained ""the birds and the bees"", and is too shy to do it. He asks the godfather, who then turns out to be too shy, too, and the godfather asks the butler in a hilariously awkward scene, who does his best to try and bring up that particular topic of discussion), there is much about Britain's appeasement politics in the 20s and 30s, and you can't help but marvel how well this all is constructed.<br/><br/>The first quarter or so is dry (lots of ""philosophy of butlering"") but it sets up the character - so if you're finding yourself bored, keep on working, it will be worth it in the end."						0

It's still a good introduction in how to think about science in popular communication, and a start on how to critically check their claims, but you won't learn statistics.<br/><br/>Towards the end there's a bit of unnecessary ""stuff"" (in a chapter called ""Stuff"") that doesn't fit the rest of the book and feels ""tacked on"" - like an introduction to a train's book.<br/><br/>Interestingly Goldacre added an essay he wrote as a just-finished med undergrad, at the young age of 23.

(Disclaimer: I'm not religious at all)<br/><br/>Nothing (except maybe the events on earth) is overdone, the book is <i>earnest</i>; in the beginning, when all is still well, the email-like dialogues between Peter, on planet Oasis, and his wife Bea back on earth border on the sugary sweet, which is what I'm used to from happy Christian couples, during the course of the novel both start to doubt their beliefs, and the language in the mails becomes dissonant, she is truthful, he still hides behind bible quotes (which by the way, mirrors my experience with the few people I know who are religious from birth - if things get very hard, there's a crisis of faith). She has a crisis, he has a crisis of a different kind, it's honest.<br/><br/>The aliens most reminded me of Lem's aliens, they're either impossible to understand or everything is a misunderstanding -<spoiler>in fact, their interest in Christianity is entirely founded on a misunderstanding of English</spoiler>- even the rain on the planet with its unexplainable movements reminded me of Solaris' ocean. The private company sending everyone to the planet makes sense - earth-water costs $50 per bottle and is deducted from the salary, since transport is expensive. Workers are strange and remind me of ""drones"", but that is the psychological profile needed if you're stuck on another planet on your own. There is no ""evil"" in the company, just straightforward capitalism.<br/><br/>I'm currently stuck in another country waiting for a visa, while my fiancée is a 20 hour plane ride away that I can't take anyway, since there's an 8 hour time difference we communicate mostly in writing, so the book struck a totally unexpected chord with me.

Religion is my least favorite part, possibly because my interest into religion is so low.<br/> <br/>I especially like Dyson's penchant to connect seemingly unconnected fields, and how quick he starts to ""think big"" without any fear of looking ridiculous (remember the <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dyson_sphere"">Dyson sphere</a>?) - I'm a fan of the concept of using genetically modified trees to terraform the inside of asteroids.

My job was to stand next to a machine which filled plastic bags with cheap, mixed white wine, and a conveyor belt put these bags into boxes. Australians call these bags affectionately ""goon bags"". My task was to put the filled boxes on pallets.<br/> <br/>I worked with a man about 30 years my senior - he had worked in that factory for more than 20 years, the last 10 years on that machine. With my 19 years, in a state that constantly seeks the new, that man was my nightmare personified, and I could not understand how he could stand this life. <br/>My perception of his life as a nightmare wasn't improved by the fact that his first action, every morning, was to take the first filled goon bag. He drank one bag per shift. I once asked him half-jokingly what his future plans were - he answered: ""I have only 15 years to go, then I can retire!"" That answer gave me a minor panic attack. <br/><br/>I soon lived in his world: I don't know if you've ever worked in a factory, but once you're fully in a mindless repetitive task, time ceases to exist. After 2 weeks of work, 8 hour shifts were over in seconds, and at home I was too tired to stop the flow of seconds. A month of this work felt like 3 minutes, and I could understand how the man could treat 15 years so flippantly; to him, 15 years are half an hour.<br/><br/>This book transported me right back into that mindset: ""I still have time"", the lie based on the vague hope that something might happen to you, while the days are just slipping away. The K.-like passivity I so easily fall into, based on the lie that things happen to me, I don't have to make them happen. This book gave me a minor panic attack.<br/><br/>Recommended for: People who think there's still time, this book is a warning."						0

And it's not like he's evading the war - if he doesn't lie in his recollections, then he's at the forefront of every battle, always overtaking his own people. He makes Die Hard movies look plausible.<br/><br/>Two really weird aspects about the book:<br/><br/>1) He is a huge fan of wartime heroism - he doesn't care for why or what he fights, as long as he can prove his ""Ritterlichkeit"", his chivalry. If he dies, so be it; it would be an honour to die on the battle-field (one is reminded of Mishima). In fact lots of people in this book die for absolutely nothing (one example are his ""boys"", the lower ranks who have to do his minor tasks for him - several of them die getting his food).<br/><br/>2) (This one might be lost in translation if you don't read the German original) He often uses the language of sports to describe the war, which feels rather strange when he talks about his friends being blown up in the words that I know only from tennis. Storming the enemy's trenches is a ""short, sports-like sensation"" - injured soldiers are ""ausgeschieden"" (eliminated? but that word is used in death,too) , which nowadays is only used for sportsmen who're forced to leave the competition due to external circumstances  - he's injured during a huge battle, yet he's sad about leaving the battlefield in this ""interesting moment"". <br/><br/>Maybe this is a product from the fact that he doesn't shy back from his own monstrosity - there are several scenes in the book in which he's just a twitch away from executing unarmed enemies; he often shoots fleeing soldiers in the back. A modern Iraq veteran writing about his war like this would be branded a psychopath (yet he might not be lying).<br/><br/>The <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ernst_J%C3%BCnger"">Jünger Wikipedia article</a> makes for good reading, too - he was against National Socialism to the point that he had connections to the Stauffenberg bomb plot. Only his famous <i>In Stahlgewittern</i> and his extremely high-level merits saved him from being executed. Interestingly, he later experimented with many drugs and became a good friend of Albert Hofmann, the discoverer of LSD. It's the last thing I expected from a far-right conservative war hero.<br/><br/>Recommended for: <br/>Those interested in history or war, this year's centennial is a good chance to read this.<br/><br/>Not recommended for: The squeamish, there's blood, brains and severed body pieces on practically every page."						0

I've already got a bit of a career in science, I don't need chapters telling me how a theory is formed. The various facts about different ant colonies are quite inspiring, though.<br/><br/>One note: It's often said that Wilson doesn't like maths and tells other people they don't need it, but here the position is a bit better fleshed out, and more agreeable: <br/>1) he only talks about algebra as used for model building and in theoretical biology, he never mentions statistics at all (which you'll need, dear student).<br/>2) he correctly says that the time investment into learning all the maths is better invested elsewhere if you got diverging interests - you can always find a collaborator who's better at mathematics than you are. The last two chapters, in which Wilson describes how theories are developed and tested using stories from his life, show that; he always lists collaborators who built the models based on his data.<br/>In the end, it seems he says 'you don't need maths' as a bit of 'propaganda', since there are prospective scientists who end up in different careers out of a fear of mathematics.<br/><br/>Recommended for: High school students/undergrads who are looking for something to do with their lives						0

Starting around 1890 and ending in 1939, this is something of a memoir of Stefan Zweig, one of the most famous German-language Austrian writers of the early 20th century. But it's less about Zweig himself than about the <i>artistic world</i> of Vienna and Paris before the first world war. Both had a brimming high culture that, if Zweig doesn't call on too much hyperbole, I haven't encountered once in my life. Both cultures never seem to have recovered from both world wars - I've been to Vienna and was greeted by arrogance; I've been to Paris and was greeted by the smell of asparagus (rs4481887 (A;A) says hello). Maybe it takes a few hundred years more?<br/><br/>Several times the book surprised me - did you know that before 1914, you didn't need a passport for anything? Zweig travelled to the US and to India without one; and, to kill some time, found 5 different jobs open to anyone; no-one had visa or passports back then, it wasn't needed. I also didn't know that Austrian women around 1900 lived extremely strict lives; no woman was allowed to know about her sexuality, it was the husband's job during the wedding night to, um, give a crash-course. (Interesting sidenote: Zweig firmly believed that prostitution went down after these strict rules disappeared. I'm skeptical.)<br/><br/>I was also surprised to learn in what an environment Zweig grew up in: his circle of adolescent friends all started to publish in literary magazines around 17, 18 years old - all of them constantly writing and bouncing ideas off each other, meeting with such famous writers as Hoffmansthal and more. In fact it's amazing what famous names show up in this book, many names of the greatest artists appear. Some of those were Zweig's friends, some of them colleagues, all of them described in several scenes: Theodor Herzl, Rudolf Steiner, Romain Rolland (he was of particular importance to Zweig and appears often), Rilke (especially fun descriptions of him - somehow comically inept at life), Yeats, Gorky, Walter Rathenau (!!), Karl Haushofer, Emile Verhaeren, Ignaz Seipel, James Joyce, H.G. Wells, and many many more.<br/><br/>Surprising too that Zweig, after he enrolled in university, immediately took three years off. You can't do that anymore - universities have lost their role of creating ""citizens"", now universities are concerned with churning out <i>Humankapital</i> in the duty of neoliberalism and capitalism (I'm just jealous). It's also fun to know that the <i>Burschenschaften</i> and <i>Verbindungen</i> back then were the same idiotic far-right weirdos they are now (except that nowadays, most of them stopped fencing with ""real"" weapons - the visible facial scar has disappeared from Germany's intelligentsia).<br/><br/>Zweig saw himself as a citizen of the world first, and much of this book is concerned with the European project and the slow death of the ""Weltgewissen"" (the world's conscience). The parts in which both world wars start are heart-breaking, and the strongest of the book; Zweig sees the suffering, and suffers himself. He knew that we as human can only get past the violence if we unite. Maybe now my generation has a chance again - humans from all countries are connected to each other, in fact, I'd wager that most of my friends grew up in the Internet first and in their country second.<br/><br/>Recommended for: People who see themselves as citizens of the world.

The authors go to lengths to put every stage in Darwin's life in the context of the bigger social movements surrounding Darwin.<br/><br/>Some other things I learned:<br/><br/>- If you've got an earth-shattering theory, make sure that everybody respects you based on other work first; Darwin published a geological book on coral reefs, and then worked for 5 years on barnacles. You'll also need influential friends who will publicly support your theories, and fight for them.<br/><br/>- Similar to Galileo in Feyerabend's Against Method, the war around Natural Selection wasn't won using science, but propaganda. Darwin had many scientific friends who fought his public wars for him, Thomas Huxley being at the front. I have to read a biography on Huxley, ""Darwin's bulldog"", next - luckily Adrian Desmond wrote on, too.<br/><br/>- Ideas never stand alone in a vacuum. I knew before this book that Darwin's theories on natural selection are based on the already known concept of evolution, on Malthus and Lyell. This book does a great job of exhibiting all minor and major influences on Darwin's thinking.<br/><br/>- Something I heard for the first time in this book is how precarious Darwin's health was. Psychosomatic? Crohn's disease? The book never explains it, but after every minor period of stress, Darwin either vomited or had to retreat to his bed for a week. He rarely held public speeches, preferring letters. Bad reviews could send him to bed for weeks. (On writing this I checked Google - <a href=""http://rsnr.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/61/1/23.full"">at least one publication says he had Crohn's disease</a>)<br/><br/>- Back then, people had their children late in life - I remember at least one couple in the book where the mother gives birth to her first child at 38. Darwin's wife Emma gave birth to their last, tenth child at the age of 48. People say that ""older"" mothers are a recent trend, doesn't seem to be the case?<br/><br/>- Darwin pioneered a few approaches for which we have fancy buzzwords now. He tracked most of the things he did, including all scores of all Backgammon games against his wife, his health - we call that Quantified Self now. On scientific questions, he tracked and kept all minor details about his work - sending out questionnaires to all parties that could possibly have anything to do with the question, which before him wasn't that common.<br/><br/>- Science 150 years ago had a completely different model of funding. Darwin himself was mostly funded by his father, the Voyage of the Beagle was completely paid for by Dr. Darwin. Later on, Darwin's money came from farms his father bought him, living the Dickensian dream. At the beginning of Darwin's career, science was mostly done by ""unemployed gentlemen scholars"" (of which there is <a href=""http://robertedgar.wordpress.com/2010/05/04/an-unemployed-gentleman-scholar/"">nowadays only one</a>), but the employment model changed during his life towards what we have now, mostly government-funded.<br/><br/>- Since the majority of this book is based on letters, I wonder how biographies of the future will work. Nowadays it's all emails, most of them in password-protected data vaults that will disappear when the hosting company (inevitably) disappears. I'd like to read scientific journals of historians a hundred years in the future - with publications such as ""How to restore e-mails from the early 21st century email client, Mozilla Thunderbird"".<br/><br/>- Like many successful people, Darwin (for the longest time) didn't know what he wanted to do with his life. He had a Pokemon-like obsession with collecting bugs, the Voyage of the Beagle only happened because of luck. Reassuring if you're, like me, one of those people who for the longest time just drifted along in life.<br/><br/>- Huxley coined ""agnostic"" when he got annoyed that opponents of natural selection always tried to drag the debate onto religious grounds. Haeckel (nowadays mostly known for his beautiful naturalistic paintings) coined many terms we use today in biology - ""phylum"", ""phylogeny"", and many more. The story of Haeckel, with his broken English, meeting Darwin, with his barely existing German, is one of the cutest stories in the book.<br/><br/>Not recommended for: People who want their history cut-and-dry; this book belongs to narrative history, often describing things which the author could have no way of knowing.<br/><br/>Recommended for: People who like to trace the development of ideas.

Bob Young	0596001088	9780596001087	3	3.87	O'Reilly Media	Paperback	258	2001	1999	2014/07/14	2014/07/01	programming	programming (#6)	read	"This book describes two 'modes' or 'metaphors' for software development - the old 'Cathedral' one, in which a few programmers, locked away from the world, slowly release iterations of their software to the world, a mode employed by the business world. Then there's the new 'Bazaar', in which rapid development around a core team of developers is favoured, developers who are constantly in contact with users and co-developers - most of open source software development happens like this.<br/><br/>It's an interesting time-document that directly led to the founding of what's now known as Mozilla, but it's also outdated. Reading the arguments I couldn't help but constantly think 'but what about Heartbleed?' for most points - for those few who haven't heard of it, Heartbleed is/was a huge security bug in the widely used openSSL library that enabled attackers to read arbitrary memory of any SSL-enabled webserver.<br/><br/>Especially towards the end the book builds up a few straw-men to take down, and then it gets annoying - like when the book says that 'Bazaar' style development doesn't need the business (Cathedral) world's top-down style management, because open source is just so much <i>fun</i> that it doesn't need managers! 'But what about heartbleed?': the OpenSSL code is such a notorious mess that for years developers who wanted to fix any problems recoiled as if encountering a Lovecraftian horror, quickly abandoning their good intentions to save their sanity. The argument of 'many shallow eyes see all important bugs' obviously didn't pan out, the bug existed for years.<br/><br/>Only now are some openBSD people working on fixing OpenSSL in LibreSSL, but for them it's a concerted effort with 'management' involved, so it seems to be some kind of chimera between Bazaar and Cathedral, in which only very few 'outsiders' are involved.<br/><br/>I guess Bazaar style development doesn't work that well for security relevant software; it's insanely complicated and there are too many 'bad' agents (like the NSA) who can act as good 'customers of the Bazaar'. <br/><br/>But it still goes some good points here and there, like for example this one:<br/><br/><blockquote><br/>Treating your users as co-developers is your least-hassle route to rapid code improvement and effective debugging.<br/></blockquote><br/><br/>It's a quick read, I'd recommend it to all open source programmers interested into seeing where their hobby comes from.<br/><br/>UPDATE 30.12.2014: I just found <a href=""http://queue.acm.org/detail.cfm?id=2349257&ref=fullrss"">this longer good essay</a> revisiting the main points of the book, quote:<br/><br/><blockquote><br/>That is the sorry reality of the bazaar Raymond praised in his book: a pile of old festering hacks, endlessly copied and pasted by a clueless generation of IT ""professionals"" who wouldn't recognize sound IT architecture if you hit them over the head with it. It is hard to believe today, but under this embarrassing mess lies the ruins of the beautiful cathedral of Unix, deservedly famous for its simplicity of design, its economy of features, and its elegance of execution.

171126	Confessions of a Yakuza	Junichi Saga	Saga, Junichi	John Bester	4770019483	9784770019486	3	3.76	Kodansha	Paperback	264	1995	1989	2014/09/02	2014/06/30	biography, japan	biography (#13), japan (#6)	read	"Interesting short look into a subculture that ceased existing in the 50s, and into Japan from 1910 to 1950 - the English title is a bit unfitting and too flashy. The original title, which roughly translates to ""The age of the Asakusa gamblers"", fits best (and in this case, the word for gamblers is <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bakuto"">Bakuto</a>). The main character of the book <i>is</i> a Yakuza, but not the kind you associate with it today - their only trade is illegal gambling, the kind of gambling you might know from Samurai period movies. You know: three guys sitting at a table, the guy in the middle half-naked who's job it is to throw the dice, everybody shouting 'Odds!' or 'Even!' to bet on the outcome, the other two guys collecting or handing out money, that's it.<br/><br/>There are a couple of wonderful scenes - for example, at one point the Yakuza are told by the police to hand in all of their guns or they would be shut down. Since guns were practically impossible to get, they didn't have any, but in order to escape persecution they had to move heaven and earth to find some. In the end, they bought three guns, each at the price of a <i>house</i>, so they could hand those in to the police.<br/><br/>It's not particularly well-written (translated?), and the story stays a bit unfocused, but it's quite interesting."						0
12041966	Robert Oppenheimer: A Life Inside the Center	Ray Monk	Monk, Ray		0385504071	9780385504072	5	4.08	Doubleday	Hardcover	848	2013	2012	2014/08/19	2014/06/24	biography, america, history	biography (#12), america (#20), history (#3)	read	A biography of Robert Oppenheimer that is also a history of Jewish immigration and the inner life of second generation migrants, of quantum physics, of the Manhattan Project, of quantum electrodynamics, of McCarthy's communism hysteria, the history of theoretical physics as an institution in the United States, and much more. <br/><br/>One of the last polymaths, Oppenheimer could read Sanskrit and Greek, speak and read several languages (he liked to quote Baudelaire in French, and his famous quote 'Now, I am become Death, the destroyer of worlds' from the Bhagavad Gita comes from his reading it in the Sanskrit), yet for all of his intelligence he had quite a few brainfarts in his time. Without his stupid and unnecessary lies in the 50s, the entire FBI communist scare theatre in which  he lost his security clearance wouldn't have happened this way. His earlier physics papers had quite a few mathematical errors, but he did predict the existence of positrons and of black holes.<br/><br/>This book is full of small, beautiful details and inspiring stories, too many to quote here. I only have '18246 characters left'.<br/><br/>Recommended for: Fans of everything.<br/><br/>Not recommended for: People who need to see thoughts laid out in linear time. When describing the development of physical theories, Monk has a habit of jumping into the future, as in: 'The first clue towards this new particle was #{something} (20 years later, it was revealed that this particle was actually two particles). The second clue was #{something else}.' It's a bit like Holmes describing the first clue, then revealing who the murder was, and then revealing the second clue.<br/><br/>P.S.: Who knew that after relativity, Einstein's contributions to physics were less than minor for more than 30 years?<br/><br/>P.P.S.: Two quotes of Oppenheimer that are very important today.<br/><br/>On secrecy around the atomic bombs:<br/><br/><blockquote><br/>There is grave danger for us that these decisions have been taken on the basis of facts held secret. This is not because the men who must contribute to the decisions, or must make them, are lacking in wisdom; it is because wisdom itself cannot flourish, nor even truth be determined, without the give and take of debate and criticism. The relevant facts could be of little use to an enemy,yet they are indispensable for an understanding of questions of policy.<br/></blockquote><br/><br/>On knowing yourself:<br/><br/><blockquote><br/>It is the knowledge of the inwardness of evil, and an awareness that in our dealings with this we are very close to the center of life. It is true of us as a people that we tend to see all devils as foreigners,; it is true of us ourselves, most of us, who are not artists, that in our public life, and to a distressing extent our private life as well, we reflect and project and externalize what we cannot bear to see within us. When we are blind to the evil in ourselves, we dehumanize ourselves, and we deprive ourselves not only of our own destiny, but of any possibility of dealing with the evil in others.<br/></blockquote>						0

262762	Cultural Amnesia: Necessary Memories from History and the Arts	Clive James	James, Clive		0393061167	9780393061161	5	4.09	W. W. Norton & Company	Hardcover	876	2007	2007	2014/07/09	2014/06/18	autobiography, biography, essays, on-writing, on-living	autobiography (#9), biography (#10), essays (#5), on-writing (#2), on-living (#4)	read	Oh, what a book.<br/><br/>James (who I'd never heard of before) summarizes a lifetime of reading, and note-taking, and it's essay-sized fireworks for 800+ pages. He usually starts off with a mini-biography of the essay's namesake, only then to go wherever the links take him - reading these essays feels like talking to someone who's in love with his work. 'This guy wrote some of the greatest essays ever, oh by the way if you like him there's this half-forgotten contemporary artist whose arias you should listen to, did I tell you I once met his cousin and we had the most wonderful discussion of Aristotle?' - this breathless love is how most of the essays are structured.<br/><br/>The essays are ordered alphabetically, James writes that this order is arbitrary, yet I can't help but think that it's no coincidence that the book ends with the essay on Stefan Zweig. The Austrian <i>Kaffeehaus</i>-culture of liberal humanism under the roof of the arts is one of the major themes of all essays. The destruction of the Austrian culture by the Austria's <i>Anschluß</i> (the word Anschluß appears at least 50 times) and the scattering of Paris' intellectuals during the German invasion, is heavily implied to be the worst thing to have happened to the European intellectual life in the last 100 years, and most of the essays focus on that particular group of people. It's a joy to read his takedown of Sartre, and his love for such greats as Polar, Camus, Chamfort, Croce, Kafka, Friedell,  Reich-Ranicki (as a German, that made me happy) is gigantic and jumps off the pages, infecting you. I've underlined so many books, it's going to be a minor chore to add them to my to-read shelf.<br/><br/>Luckily, James is also a funny writer:<br/><br/><blockquote><br/>Lysenko preached the kind of biological theories that Stalin could understand: i.e., they were poppycock.<br/></blockquote><br/><br/>Some of the essays are rather strange, in these, James just goes off the track too far. The essay on Sophie Scholl quickly morphs into one about Natalie Portman (and Portman gets way more pages, weirdly enough), the essay on Charlie Chaplin immediately turns into a lacklustre discussion of art vs. science (and I've read better things about that particular 'conflict'), one essay is a bit about how the 'degeneration' of English is bad: as a biologist, I firmly believe that people who hold beliefs like that would have stood on shore while the first reptile crawled on land, telling the reptile to 'stop degenerating'. The essay on Heinrich Heine is just an overlong negative rant about autograph seekers.<br/><br/>The worst essay is also the most Australian one, in which he rants for pages on pages on how the Afghani asylum seekers on board the Tampa bound to Australia in 2001 are just 'illegal immigrants' and 'queue jumpers', who should have just stayed in their home country until their application would have been accepted. It's especially worse because James, at that point, has spent 400 pages being in love with WW2-era intellectuals who've done nothing but 'jump queues' when they've escaped their home-country - can you imagine Einstein just sitting in Germany while the Gestapo is kicking down doors, waiting for his letter of invitation? Thomas Mann, too, was allowed into the USA without any papers, and Czechoslovakia even offered him citizenship so that he could formally immigrate.<br/><br/>Sometimes, his own character comes through too much, I think this is best exemplified by this sentence:<br/><br/><blockquote><br/>When filming in Rome, I had a jacket made by the celebrated tailor Littrico, and found out that I had the same measurements as Gorbachev: they were on file in Littrico's office.<br/></blockquote><br/><br/>To which I can only say: so what?<br/><br/>But these <i>Rohrkrepierer</i>-essays are in the tiny minority. I'd love to see a book like this on the life and work of scientists (if I remember correctly, only one of the 'good' essays has to do with science).<br/><br/>Recommended for: People who can't get enough stuff into their brain.<br/><br/>Not recommended for: People who, if they go on travelling to a beautiful country, get angry if there's a detour.<br/>						0

I had teachers who went to university in the 'progressive' 70s, so what they talked about all day is your feelings and their feelings and it's all very annoying when you just want to set things on fire. The authors circumvent the issue by pretending that children don't exist. A note like 'btw, this stuff doesn't work with children' would have helped.						0
162780	What Is Life? with Mind and Matter and Autobiographical Sketches	Erwin Schrödinger	Schrödinger, Erwin	Roger Penrose	0521427088	9780521427081	4	4.1	Cambridge University Press	Paperback	194	1992	1944	2014/05/24	2014/05/14	biology, philosophy	biology (#6), philosophy (#2)	read	"What I expected:<br/><br/><img src=""http://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/physicists.png""><br/><br/><a href=""http://xkcd.com/793/"">Source</a>, CC-BY-NC 2.5<br/><br/>What I got:<br/><br/>""What is Life?"" is a surprisingly humble take on the problems biology had in the 1940s. Schrödinger tries to summarize how physics and chemistry can help solve biology's problems, like how information is actually inherited. He often comes so close to the actual truth that you want to shout at the book while reading it - I wonder what he would have done with Rosalind Franklin's X-Ray diffraction images of DNA.... <br/><br/>In other times he's a bit lost, like when he thinks that new physical laws are needed to solve the riddle of heredity; as far as I know, we didn't need to come up with new laws. I don't think that's his fault, though: he was just hypothesizing from the data available to him at that time.<br/><br/>One of the cooler concepts Schrödinger introduces is the concept of life as a system that ""eats"" entropy and thereby evades thermodynamic equilibrium, as predicted by the second law of thermodynamics.<br/><br/>The book itself is further proof that scientists never operate in an intellectual vacuum, every great discovery is based on preceeding thougts. Both Watson and Crick, the discoverers of the DNA-structure, had read the book. Without it I doubt they would have thought of the structure the way they did.<br/><br/>The second book ""Mind and Matter"" is much more philosophical in nature and concerns free will, the self and how we perceive the world. Here Schrödinger quotes Indian scripture to make his point that the subject and object are one, conciousness isn't as clear cut as people commonly believe, etc. If you're into that this part will bore you. It did, however, contain a small discussion of cultural heredity in the form of ""Mnemes"" - something which has been popularized by Dawkins in the last few decades.<br/><br/>Recommended for: Fans of science, it's so short you can read it in an afternoon. People interested in the history of science, What Is Life? is one of the most influental scientific books of the last 100 years (judging on how many scientists cite it as their prime inspiration to get into biology)."						0

Karma exists but it it's more useful for reincarnation - there is no all-encompassing ""good"" like in the Christian worldview.<br/><br/>The entire folklore of Japanese yokai is fascinating, and Hearn touches on some of them, like the Yuki-Onna, but it's often feels like Hearn influences the stories too much.<br/><br/>The last few chapters are all weird, starting with an autobiographical story of Hearn that I did not particularly care for, then continuing with a strange description of Horai, a mythical Chinese and Japanese place, but the description differs from anything else in the Japanese literature and must have been mostly invented by Hearn. Sadly, this ""taints"" the other preceding stories: I can't tell whether Hearn influenced them, or if they're ""proper"" Japanese stories. <br/><br/>Even weirder is the finishing chapter with Hearn's thoughts on butterflies, mosquitoes and ants. Interestingly he described that ants keep mushrooms, I thought that was a more recent discovery.<br/><br/>Recommended for: Fans of Japan, and those who like Folklore stories. I think most people can skip the last 3 chapters."						0

Remember 'No one told you when to run, you missed the starting gun'? In a way, this novel's narrator completely missed the gun - he's 37, has never really connected with his family, always did what he was told.. His mother is diagnosed with cancer, in a panicky attempt he tries to reconnect with her, but she's obviously got other problems. It's a fine, quiet description of a life not really lived.  <br/><br/>So why did I give this only 3 stars? I think I'm too young for this. In 20 years, or so, this book might resonate more with me.						0

When Tolkien creates the world of LOTR, he gives the reader only a glimpse of what Tolkien has built - he tells you that there are a ton of different races, but in the story not all of them appear; Tolkien tells you that all of these races have complete, twisted, intertwined back-stories, but gives you only a glimpse, as much as you need to know. Butcher, on the other hand, creates only exactly as much back story as needed - there are 3 types of werewolves, ergo all of them have to appear (however ham-fisted their inclusion in the story is [1]), he tells you all there is about them (not much) and then has all the characters act out all there is to them, nothing is left to the fog... In other words: if Butcher had directed the original Star Wars trilogy, Boba Fett wouldn't have had a helmet.<br/><br/>And, I get that most of the characters are wolves, but honestly, using 'he/she/it snarled' instead of the classic 'he said' gets tiring fast.						0

There's of course a murder, a bit of damsel in distress, a few friends in low places, a couple of bad guys, and magic, everything you'd expect from the mix.<br/><br/>Sometimes the ""fantasy"" and the ""noir"" elements clash for the worse, Butcher has to pull some story tricks to have an overpowered wizard who's also the downbeaten looser who's in a case over his head, and it doesn't work well all the time.<br/><br/>Still, it's a fun, quick read if you want something to entertain you for an afternoon or a trainride.

Glover doesn't offer many solutions for the future (maybe in another book?) except that we need political restraints on a world scale (but: if you have a world police, that police can kill without problems) and we need to learn how to develop ethics and psychology in the face of technology that enables us to kill men, women, children at the press of a button.<br/><br/>A few personal takeaways:<br/><br/>- People <i>actually learn from history</i>, and they actually <i>learn from books!</i> During the Cuba Missile Crisis the Soviets cited their personal war experience and Kennedy cited the First World War, especially Tuchman's <a href='https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/11366.The_Guns_of_August'>Guns of August</a>, as reasons why they did not want to continue the conflict (as a sidenote, reading the letters and opinions of the US military leaders who wanted to keep the conflict going makes you realize how realistic Jack D. Ripper in Dr. Strangelove is)<br/><br/>- History repeats itself, all the time; when the Athenians attacked the Melians, they 'presented [their] hard amoralism as mere realism'. Everyone else has done that since, here in Australia the current government clouds their inhumanity in the guise of 'adults being in charge'.<br/><br/>- In a way, the First World War was present at Nagasaki and Hiroshima. Glover makes a nice case how the 'modern' sliding of standards in regards to the death of civilians in wartime started at the blockade of Hamburg in WW1, went on to the indiscriminate bombing of civilians from Germans and the British, and culminated in the atomic bombs. If this book would have come out later it would have included indiscriminate drone killings in the Middle East in that slide.<br/><br/>- Internet trolls with absolute horrifying opinions in the comment section of news-articles are nothing new:<br/><blockquote><br/>[...] another American massacre of Japanese survivors in lifeboats provoked a letter of moral criticism, which was published. Many of the replies to that letter claimed that Japanese atrocities justified the massacre. One reader wrote of 'killing a helpless rattlesnake'. Another had 'thoroughly enjoyed' reading about the slaughter'. Another said that a 'good old American custom I would like to see is nailing a Jap hide on every ""backhouse"" door in America'.<br/></blockquote><br/><br/>- Glover doesn't like Heidegger in the slightest: 'The inarticulate complexity is Heidegger's trademark. Can someone whose thinking is so blurred be a serious philosopher?' Or even better (you have to know that Heidegger once wrote that Hitler's hands were beautiful):<br/><br/><blockquote><br/>To imagine a meeting between them, with Heidegger glancing at Hitler's marvellous hands and talking about the unity of the outside-of-itself in the raptures of the future, is to be reminded how easily the Führer was moved to rage. That the two men did not meet is one of surrealism's great losses in the twentieth century.<br/></blockquote><br/><br/>Not recommended for: <br/>1) The squeamish. Every atrocity is introduced with several personal eyewitness accounts, it makes for good nightmare material. In fact, I think I had weird nightmares every single night while reading this book (but: correlation != causation)<br/>2) People who love people, your beliefs might take a punch:<br/><blockquote><br/>The widespread enthusiasm even now for capital punishment seems to reflect something more than a concern to reduce crime rates. When capital punishment was the law in Britain, there were about five applications a week for the post of executioner.<br/></blockquote><br/><br/>Recommended for: People interested in changing the future by learning from the past."						0

Since this is reality, there is no 'red thread' going through the book - people appear, they disappear, they reappear, most of the time they die.<br/><br/>The major theme of the novel is brutality, so if you can't stomach that, stay away. In this book the Russian army has a pecking order based on sheer brutality, the new ones get beaten up by the old ones, the higher rungs beat up the lower ones, etc. - and not just a slap, but kicks in the face until teeth fall out, every night. Chechen warriors disembowel captured Russians, or publicly slit their throats. People get blown up, so that only a foot is sent home in a zinc coffin, welded shut. Mothers of missing soldiers are accidentally shot - they've come to Chechnya to find their sons, since the chaotic Russian army can't really keep track of anything. Deserters run away? Eh, so what, they'll die anyway. Newcomers steal some ammunition? The officers get drunk, beat up the newcomers brutally over days, mock-execute them, until they kick them out naked into Chechnya; left to die.<br/><br/>I can't really understand the comparison to Catch-22 in Goodreads' description - Catch-22 was an over-the-top satire which took many freedoms to get the point across, One Soldier's War is just nihilist brutality from start to end.						0
6772577	The Cleanest Race: How North Koreans See Themselves and Why It Matters	B.R.   Myers	Myers, B.R.		1933633913	9781933633916	4	3.93	Melville House	Hardcover	208	2010	2010	2014/05/01	2014/04/26	non-fiction, korea	non-fiction (#40), korea (#1)	read	<br/>This is a surprisingly interesting book - the author sets out to show that North Korea has two 'sets' of propaganda, one is mainly used internally, the other is shown to the world. The outdoor propaganda is Juche Thought, a relatively inconsistent quasi-Communist waffling no-one really bothers to understand or 'fix'. The internal propaganda (called 'the Text' in the book) is interesting - a racist national set of ideas, initially copied from the Japanese under Hirohito, and then amended over the decades. <br/><br/>The Koreans are the 'purest' people, and since they're so 'pure' they need protection from the outside world from the Dear Leader, the most Korean Korean. The Koreans are a child-like race too pure, under constant threat from  outside evils such as 'Yankees', diverse 'puppet regimes' of the Yankees like the South Koreans, and other threats to their purity. It's a little bit like North Koreans see themselves like one of these overbred dogs who can't walk up stairs on his own.<br/><br/>This is all very interesting to learn, especially as the depth of Western media's reporting on the DPRK can be summarized as 'look at these weirdos lololol here's the weather' Myers seems to have strong opinions on other Western DPRK researchers, and since I know very little about North Koreans, I can't judge how accurate he is. In fact, if what this book says it's true, it's going to be much, much more difficult to change the political situation in North Korea than it was in East Germany - East Germans saw the economical success of West Germany and wanted the same which was one of the factors leading to collapse, North Korea sees the economical success of South Korea and treats it as a sign of their 'unpure' depravity. Even if the military leadership is replaced or eliminated like in Iraq, people won't be cheering - you can't just replace an entire mythology, taught over 50 years, over night and think people will accept you.<br/><br/>Sadly this book is a bit short, and was published before Kim Jong-un became leader/president/head honcho. I would've liked to read what Myers thinks of Kim Jong-un - he certainly seems to portray the 'child-like' in the North Korean mythology very well [1]. As a biologist, I would have also liked to read more about the 'scientific' side of the racist myth, since the Soviet Union had their own science (Lysenkoism) and ran experiments etc. Does that scientific side even exist?<br/><br/>Bonus fact: You can read this book pretending it's about an alien race on Venus and it still works!<br/><br/>Recommended for: People interested in authoritarian regimes, different ways to view the world, Korea, communism, and those who like to read excerpts from strange, alien novels.<br/><br/>Not recommended for: People who like to cling to their belief that North Korea is led by a bunch of bumbling fools.<br/><br/>[1] Seriously, on all official pictures he looks like a fat baby.						0

The hitchhikers are then fattened and sold on their home-world as a delicacy [1]. See?</spoiler>). <br/><br/>But unlike ""classic"" SF, this one is much more about the inner life of the characters. The book is best when the alien has just picked up a hitchhiker - it's always the nervous, broken inner monologue of the alien who fears that she may be discovered, and who dies on the inside as she knows that she'll never be able to return - then it switches over to her passenger, who in Scottish dialect tries to make sense of her (often on a sexual level). <br/><br/>Most of the time these ""non-dialogues"" are hilariously awkward, like when she tries to find a topic to small-talk in order to find out whether the police will look for the hitchhiker, while he tries to find any topic to start on.<br/><br/>Recommended for: vegetarians? <br/><br/>Not recommended for: people who can't see past the SF<br/><br/>[1] <spoiler>For the longest time, I thought there would be a twist in the end that reveals that the aliens are actually time travelers from the future since their world is so much like a classic human dystopia, but no twist.</spoiler>"						0

Ford				4	3.85	Princeton University Press	Kindle Edition	269	2012	2012	2014/11/17	2014/04/06	biology	biology (#10)	read	"A very interesting take on agriculture with a focus on plants and their future - the author applies Dawkin's selfish gene concept to explain and hypothesize about various concepts floating around agriculture right now. <br/>He's got three basic ideas on which the book is based on - the first is that natural selection doesn't miss easy ror tradeoff-free improvements; in these chapters there's disappointment in the promises of GM-advocates, as the ""low hanging fruits"" of plant improvement may not exist. I don't fully agree with this - after all, evolution hasn't stopped and given us perfect species, and without the fitting natural selection, the low hanging fruit may still be there - but I can see what he means. <br/><br/>The second point is that competitive success is better than success by persisting - for example,  forests or ecosystems usually don't compete against each other, so there is no telling whether their actual composition is ""ideal"" or not - maybe yes, maybe no, the point is that the blind copying of this abundance can either help or hurt, we have no clue as to what outside pressures these compositions developed. Just because they have persisted doesn't mean that should blindly copy them.<br/><br/>In these chapters are the best (and most science-fiction-ish) ideas - for example, wheat grows larger because of inter-individual competition for light, which isn't good for us humans since then yield is lower, the plant has to put resources into growing instead of into our food. Borlaug reversed this process by introducing dwarf wheat with a much higher yield. Denison propose that we create plants that actually cooperate each other, for example, by making sure that plants in the vicinity get enough light, while the plants grow in such a way that harmful weeds are shaded. Quite outlandish, but doable! There's also a very interesting discussion on assisting plants in selecting for ""helpful"" rhizobia in varying nodules.<br/><br/>Right now our only successes in plant modification is that they express toxins, which is relatively easy, it's just a single gene that isn't particularly part of any system. If you start to modify salinity resistance, for example, the image gets bleaker - we've had some success by introducing ion pumps from salinity-resistant species, but these systems are still too unknown to drastically improve yield. Changing species so that they cooperate, that's still far, far away.<br/><br/>The third point is a relatively obvious one - we should always hedge bets and not bet on just one approach, this chapter is a bit more political as it includes various taxing schemes (an interesting Nitrogen-tax is proposed where farmers pay per kg of Nitrogen used, but get a tax bonus for every kg that is actually used - for example, 1000kg of wheat use 23kg of Nitrogen, so these 23kg would receive a bonus).<br/><br/>I don't always agree with his ideas, for example, he's a bit disappointed that so much money is being poured into the various -omics approaches while the ""classic"" fields of ecology and agronomy are being underfunded, he's disappointed that so many people work with <i>Arabidopsis</i> while there are so many alternative plants to work at, but I think that the omics stuff is still so early, and we still know so little about other, more complicated plants that it makes sense to keep on working with the relatively simple <i>Arabidopsis</i>.. For now. Some people try to model the human brain, but more people are working on the simple <i>C. elegans</i> with its exactly 302 neurons. <br/><br/>Bonus quote:<br/><blockquote><br/>Do legumes, like the farm-owners in The Grapes of Wrath, advertise more openings than actually exist, to attract a surplus of applicants?<br/></blockquote><br/><br/>Recommended for: Plant biologists, breeders, interested laymen, people interested in the future of agriculture, people interested in the big picture"						0

The rest of the book is just a not-so-interesting story of a guy I didn't care for, and saw no reason to care for, trying to scam everything and everybody, 'mark' after 'mark'.

It begins with how to start your job-hunt, finding your strengths, updating your Linkedin (reasonable tips there!), and finding the job that suits you. Since programming interviews are often technical in nature, the majority of this book focuses on these parts. It goes over all the basic data-structures and gives you a couple of example problems from interviews for each structure. These are good in that the author goes through a ""natural"" thinking process with each problem - starting with the ""obvious"" and ""easy"" solution, showing where the caveats are, ""loudly"" thinking about possible ways to solve it, finding the ""good"" solution, and then sometimes going further to the ""perfect"" solution (which doesn't help in interviews, but is there for pure nerd-satisfaction). <br/><br/>After a problem was solved in ""plain text"", example programs are included. These are written in Java, C++ or C. A warning here: Many solutions include low-level concepts like pointers (or even pointers to pointers), so if you've only programmed in languages without ""manual pointers"" like Python or Ruby this book won't help you much. In fact, the String problems are a little bit frustrating to read when you know the solution in Python would be a (slow) one-liner like my_string.split("" "")[::-1] (that one's surprisingly complicated in C).<br/><br/>After going through all the basic data-structures like binary trees, stacks, heaps, strings etc. a couple of non-datastructure CS related things pop up, like graphics programming, concurrency, SQL etc., which I rarely see, but good to see them included here. Then there are a few chapters on the typical ""riddles"", like <a href=""http://www.coolmath4kids.com/math_puzzles/l1-threelights.html"">this one</a> (which doesn't even work with modern light-bulbs - LEDs don't get hot, fluorescent bulbs only a little), but the authors rightly state that these are cheap pot-shots which don't really help in anything. But since they come up in interviews, they had to be included. The book concludes with a couple of examples for ""knowledge""-based questions, and a helpful appendix on structuring/writing CVs.<br/><br/>Recommended for: Job-hunting programmers, or those in the last year of their studies. People who've never been to a technical programming interview and would like to know what to expect. People who like to solve programming riddles. People who need a crash-course/refresher on data-structures and algorithms.<br/><br/>Not recommended for: Beginning programmers (too much low-level stuff). People who only program in high-level languages like Python or Ruby. People who want to study programming interview questions specifically - there are other, bigger, more complete books on that (but I don't really see the purpose behind that - in my own experience, people who learn programming solutions by heart [they exist!] can't program at all, which will hopefully become obvious in the interview).<br/>"						0

There's a bit of essays on Wallace, his success and suicide around the interviews from Lipsky, but the majority of the books is Wallace's answers and elaborations of answers to questions of Lipsky. I'd say 80% of the text is Wallace speaking, and it's great to read the thoughts of someone who's so upfront and honest about himself:<br/><br/><blockquote><br/>What I’m trying to say to you is, I went through a period so bad, that that stuff had to stop mattering to me, or I think I would’ve blown my brains out. I came reasonably close.</blockquote> <br/><br/>From time to time Lipsky injects his personal observations into the texts with [brackets like this], which feels like Lipsky is trying to remind the reader that Lipsky still exists, they don't add much and often break the flow of the answer.<br/><br/>Worthy of a read just because of this quote (and now I spoiled it for you!)<br/><br/><blockquote><br/>I think the reason why people behave in an ugly manner is that it’s really scary to be alive and to be human, and people are really really afraid. And that the reasons [...] That the fear is the basic condition, and there are all kinds of reasons for why we’re so afraid. But the fact of the matter is, is that, is that the job that we’re here to do is to learn how to live in a way that we’re not terrified all the time. And not in a position of using all kinds of different things, and using people to keep that kind of terror at bay. That is my personal opinion.<br/></blockquote><br/><br/>Addendum: Both Lipsky and Wallace were huge TV-watchers, with a section on how both can easily watch TV for 6-8 hours straight - is it just me or has that died? I know no-one who can watch that much TV without doing anything else, I can't watch TV <i>alone</i> for longer than 10 minutes before I open my laptop. Changing times?<br/>"						0

Since it's a history book, there are no characters or no dialogue - it's a bit like reading a summary of Game Of Thrones stuck on fast-forward. There are intrigues, murders, back-room deals, affairs, discussions, more murders, civil war, famous philosophers, stupidly rich people, fun quirks (only bavarians drink milk or eat sitting up!), and more.<br/><br/>I can't really say how accurate it is, since the majority of my knowledge of the time involves one fat and one tiny Frenchman, but it certainly is interesting, if not at times confusing for the large number of protagonists. It's also fun to match the values of Rome to some current superpowers:<br/><br/><blockquote><br/>Enthusiasts for empire argued that Rome had a civilising mission; that because her values and institutions were self-evidently superior to those of barbarians, she had a duty to propagate them; that only once the whole globe had been subjected to her rule could there be a universal peace.

10314376	The Prague Cemetery	Umberto Eco	Eco, Umberto	Richard Dixon	0547577532	9780547577531	3	3.34	Houghton Mifflin Harcourt	Hardcover	445	2011	2010	2014/09/28	2014/02/24	italy	italy (#3)	read	Spoilers!<br/><br/>A mix of <i>Baudolino</i> and <i>Foucault's Pendulum</i> - from <i>Baudolino</i> it has the meticulously researched historical background (except for the main character, all figures existed, and all of their strange writing did, too), from <i>Foucault's Pendulum</i> the conspiracy theories, except that this one focuses more on Freemasons and Jews than Templars.<br/><br/>The story itself is great - the reader follows the exploits of the fictitious master forger Simone Simonini who works for various secret services and is similar to <i>Baudolino</i> involved in some of the major events of Italian and French history; with Garibaldi's Italian campaign (with a cameo from Dumas), he is the forger behind the <i>Protocols of the Elders of Zion</i> as well as the note that started the Dreyfus affair, he's practically the only force behind European anti-Semitism, even though he himself isn't a very big anti-Semite, he just concentrates the opinions of others.<br/>I'm pretty sure 90% of the historical jokes went above my head. The book is best in Simonini's ethical gymnastics (as in, 'I don't forge documents, I create documents that should have existed in the first place') and various murderous shenanigans.<br/><br/>The rather convoluted structure of the novel, with one narrator summarizing a diary held jointly by the master forger Simonini and a priest who may or may not be Simonini, didn't add anything to the novel at all (to me).<br/><br/>Still worlds better than <i>The Mysterious Flame of Queen Loana</i>.<br/><br/>Recommended for: Fans of historical fiction, Eco is still the best at that.<br/>Not recommended for: People with zero knowledge of European history, I guess it'll get confusing fast.<br/><br/>P.S.: You have to choose where you read this, I'm pretty sure it's weird when your seat neighbour on the bus reads pagelong rants about how the Jews are behind everything						0
17404078	The Disaster Artist: My Life Inside The Room, the Greatest Bad Movie Ever Made	Greg Sestero	Sestero, Greg	Tom Bissell	1451661193	9781451661194	4	4.38	Simon & Schuster	Hardcover	270	2013	2013	2014/03/03	2014/02/23	america, autobiography	america (#12), autobiography (#6)	read	"Have you ever seen <i>The Room</i>? If not, just watch <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQ4KzClb1C4"">this scene</a>. Needless to say, it's <b>great</b>: ""Oh hi Mark!"". <br/><br/>If you ever wondered how that movie came to be, here's The Disaster Artist, by one of the movie's co-stars: Greg Sestero (who's Mark in the above scene). Did you know it cost 6 million dollars? Did you know it took forever to film? Did you know Wiseau kept on forgetting basic sentences <b>he himself wrote</b>? Did you know still no-one really knows where all this money came from? Did you know Wiseau is as weird in real life as he is in the movie?<br/><br/>Here Sestero describes how he met Wiseau at acting school, how he tried to get his acting career to start, his continuing friendship with Wiseau (and absolute bafflement about Wiseau, the alien/vampire/dork?), culminating in Wiseau making <i>The Room</i>, and the absolute trainwreck of the filming, which form the main part of the book. It's also the funniest.<br/><br/>The best thing about this book is that Sestero could have taken the low road of just making fun of Wiseau's absolute weirdness, and it would have destroyed the book. But instead, we get introspective sentences like this:<br/><br/><blockquote><br/>In the end, the phenomenon of The Room has allowed me to realize that, in life, anything is possible. The Room is a drama that is also a comedy that is also an existential cry for help that is finally a testament to human endurance. It has made me reconsider what defines artistic success or failure. If art is expression, can it fail? Is success simply a matter of what one does with failure? <br/></blockquote><br/><br/>But it's also funny:<br/><br/><blockquote><br/>“Tommy, don’t hurt my son.”<br/>The worst thing Tommy could do in response to this request, I thought, would be to chuckle creepily. “I would not,” Tommy said, chuckling creepily. <br/></blockquote><br/><br/><br/>Recommended for: Fans of the movie. Fans of strange humans.<br/><br/>Not recommended for: This guy <img src=""https://d2tq98mqfjyz2l.cloudfront.net/image_cache/1349918643402571.jpg""><br/><br/>(<a href=""http://harkavagrant.com/index.php?id=309"">Source</a>)<br/><br/>Addendum: I'm now convinced that Wiseau is a vampire, who else would say sentences like this?<br/><br/><blockquote><br/>“This park is perfect place for vampire,” Tommy said, looking around happily. “I think vampire from Alcatraz live here.” <br/></blockquote> <br/><br/>or this one:<br/><br/><blockquote><br/>“How do you always do that?” I asked him.<br/>“Do what?”<br/>“Know exactly when to wake up.”<br/>“Vampire trick,” Tommy said.<br/></blockquote><br/><br/>Sestero brushes the vampire jokes aside but it explains so much! Wiseau is a vampire who slept for a 1000 years, which would explain why he doesn't understand humans <i>at all</i>, why he has so much money (the gold from some Transylvanian castle), why he's so pale, his accent: no-one speaks his vague Eastern European accent since everyone who ever spoke that accent is dead! The book gets even better if you pretend that Wiseau actually <i>is</i> a vampire: ""Interview with a vampire with a severe lack of social skills""."						0

She had an interesting style of invention - during her wartime work, necessity was the mother of invention (""we need these bombing tables and we need them yesterday"", so sub-routines were invented so several problems could be attacked at once), but after it, much of her work was inspired by making programming easier and more accessible - less formulas, more English, and a ton of teaching to get more people into programming. A very inspiring story. <br/><br/>There are other very interesting parts here - in describing Hopper's way of ""distributed invention"" I was often reminded of Raymond's <a href=""https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/134825.The_Cathedral_the_Bazaar"">""The Cathedral and the Bazaar""</a>, her work was immediately shared with the community of programmers and mathematicians and their ideas were implemented (""Bazaar""-style invention, here called ""distributed invention"") which led to many improvements in A-1 and A-2. On the other hand, her work in the committee that designed COBOL was more of a ""Cathedral"" situation - a top-down committee of experts that first wrote the standard, then implemented the language.<br/><br/>Other parts reminded me of Brooks' <a href=""https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/13629.The_Mythical_Man_Month"">""The Mythical Man Month""</a> - some of their early day ""tricks"" with the Mark 1 computers (such as a library of subroutines so they'd have code that has been shown to work correctly, for example, the sin() function) is repeated as a tip in Brooks' book. And there's only about 40 years in between!<br/><br/>General Groves, who plays a relatively important part in Ray Monk's <a href=""https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/12041966-robert-oppenheimer"">biography of Oppenheimer</a> as Oppenheimer's ""military counterpart"" at the Manhattan Project, re-appears here as one of Hopper's bosses at Remington Rand. What a weird coincidence.<br/><br/>Of course, no history book wouldn't be without some ridiculously dry parts. This is definitely not ""pop"" history! I had to make more coffee when it came to the details of which committee did what and how their roles were defined, who sat at which position etc. during the creation of COBOL.<br/><br/>Recommended for: People interested in the history of computing or computers<br/><br/>Not recommended for: People who don't get a laugh out of <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grace_Hopper#/media/File:H96566k.jpg"">this picture</a>"						0

The lawmen are usually ""failed"" characters, rough men who start the day with a swig from the Whiskey bottle; the horror is, as with Lovecraft, ""from beyond reality"" and likes to eat.<br/><br/>A few stories stand out - one's interesting in that it describes a <i>helper</i> (or maybe even part) of these ""beyond"" forces, and not just the usual ""human encounters monstrous entity, looses sanity and is swallowed whole"". Another story with an ""industry espionage detective"" first dragged on forever and it felt like Barron wanted to go into cyberpunk territory, but then turned 180 degrees and became a horror story that reminded me more of Barker's Hellraiser (chains! blood! torture!) than Lovecraft's stuff. Some old horror-clichés abound too - one story features a character ""understanding"" thus plucking out his eye-balls, something that appeared in Lovecraft/Barker/King.<br/><br/>Just like with Lovecraft, the atmosphere is great, but you can't read these stories in one go: it gets tiring.<br/><br/>Recommended for: Lovecraft fans.

A Christian sect that specializes in mutilation/amputation thinks highly of him for that; after all, their members only get their parts chopped off by doctors under local anesthesia. They hire him to (supposedly) solve the murder of their head honcho, a guy who cut off most of his body. Lots and lots and lots of amputees are featured. Lots of stuff is amputated. Later, a different Christian sect appears, who are also kind of about self-mutilation. A lot of people are shot. A head is paraded around (which reminded me of the 90s game Shadow Warrior for some reason). Lots of people are shot. More people are cleaved up. The end.<br/><br/>It's detective noir + a bit of (non-supernatural) horror + splatter; not everyone's cup of tea. Reminded me, in parts, more of a comic-book than a detective book.

17660462	The Everything Store: Jeff Bezos and the Age of Amazon	Brad Stone	Stone, Brad		0316219266	9780316219266	4	3.9	Little, Brown and Company	Hardcover	384	2013	2013	2014/03/17	2014/02/19	business-time	business-time (#1)	read	"(Part of a conscious effort to read books about ""adults"" and in the process hopefully become more of an ""adult"", whatever that is)<br/><br/>Things I learned from this book:<br/><br/>1. Working at Amazon isn't much fun, in fact it's kind of terrifying<br/><br/><blockquote><br/>People left and afterward they took a breath and felt disoriented, like they had escaped a cult. Though they didn’t share it openly, many just couldn’t take working for Bezos any longer. He demanded more than they could possibly deliver and was extremely stingy with praise. At the same time, many felt a tremendous loyalty to Bezos and would later marvel at how much they accomplished at Amazon. Kim Rachmeler shared a favorite quote she heard from a colleague around that time. “If you’re not good, Jeff will chew you up and spit you out. And if you’re good, he will jump on your back and ride you into the ground.”<br/></blockquote><br/><br/>or<br/><br/><blockquote><br/>Managers in departments of fifty people or more are required to “top-grade” their subordinates along a curve and must dismiss the least effective performers. As a result of this ongoing examination, many Amazon employees live in perpetual fear. A common experience among Amazon workers is a feeling of genuine surprise when one receives a good performance review. Managers are so parsimonious with compliments that underlings tend to spend their days anticipating their termination.<br/></blockquote><br/><br/>(But: I used to work under similar ""screamy"" people, so I learned to just ignore their tantrums, so all fine on that front?)<br/><br/>2. but it can also be inspiring and apparently you learn heaps [1]:<br/><br/><blockquote><br/>“Jeff does a couple of things better than anyone I’ve ever worked for,” Dalzell says. “He embraces the truth. A lot of people talk about the truth, but they don’t engage their decision-making around the best truth at the time. “The second thing is that he is not tethered by conventional thinking. What is amazing to me is that he is bound only by the laws of physics. He can’t change those. Everything else he views as open to discussion.”<br/></blockquote><br/><br/>3. And since Amazon has become such a huge market-power, they've behaved more than dodgy (and Bezos' sayings like ""Customer first"" sound hollow)<br/><br/><blockquote><br/>Amazon had an easy way to demonstrate its market power. When a publisher did not capitulate and the company shut off the recommendation algorithms for its books, the publisher’s sales usually fell by as much as 40 percent. “Typically it was about thirty days before they’d come back and say, Ouch, how do we make this work?” says Christopher Smith, a senior book buyer at the time.<br/></blockquote><br/><br/>4. Several passages reminded me of <a href=""https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/10091466-inside-scientology"">Inside Scientology</a>, in the description of ""Jeff bots"", people who try to emulate Bezos in thinking and behaviour tcoming close to Hubbard's Sea Org:<br/><br/><blockquote><br/>“Jeff was learning as he went along. He learned things from each of us who had expertise and incorporated the best pieces into his mental model. Now everyone is expected to think as much as they can like Jeff.” Bezos’s top executives are always modeling Bezos-like behavior.<br/></blockquote> <br/><br/>So would I recommend this book? I learned that Amazon had more failures than successes, which is good to know - in retrospect it all looks like one huge success story. It also explains recent developments like Amazon's drone program, Bezos isn't scared of having far-out ideas and then pursuing them relentlessly. <br/><br/>One thing that scares me is the similarity to Apple's Steve Jobs - both not really nice people to work under, and both willing to bend and break ethics to get what they wanted. ""Some"" people see that as the reason for their success and try to emulate this behaviour. You can be extremely successful and not sell your soul - look at <a href=""https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/13482884-our-daily-bread-the-essential-norman-borlaug"">Norman Borlaug</a>, father of the green revolution, also founder of the Mexican softball league, who made sure that all of his ""lower level"" employees received university education. Or look at Valve's Steve Gaben, who gives sick employees the official job-title of ""getting better"" and pays them until they are OK again. Bezos doesn't even pay parking fees.<br/><br/>[1] yay for Australian English: Mixing data-structures and language since 1901<br/><br/>Addendum:<br/><br/>Where does success come from? It seems that most of the current Silicon Valley higher-ups had very good childhoods, with special schools, extremely early access to computers, special schooling programs for gifted children, etc. Look at Bill Gates or Jeff Bezos. At the same time, their adult versions worked extremely hard, much more than 99% of the rest of the world, and of course had luck at the right time, and were uncompromising in their ""big thinking"". All of these things?"						0

The twins are deserted, people die, people ""get disappeared"" under the regime, no-one is <i>ever</i> happy. <br/><br/>The first book was the strongest; narrated by the twins themselves, using extremely reduced and spare language, it's often shocking how desensitized both have made themselves to their surroundings. The spare language makes the brutality machine-like. Due to the brutality and suffering, which is contradicted by the twins' ""genius"" and ""otherworldliness"" (they're a bit like the children in Village Of The Damned) the first book feels more like a bleak fairytale, the second and third books are not as bleak (people actually have names in these!) and the third book even has something of a twist.<br/><br/>The two things I copied from this book: <br/><br/>'I say, ""Yes. No book, no matter how sad, can be as sad as a life.""' <br/><br/>and <br/><br/>""I tell him that life is totally useless, that it's nonsense, an aberration, infinite suffering, the invention of a non-God whose evil surpasses understanding.""<br/><br/>Bonus fact: The famous Japanese Super Nintendo roleplaying game Mother 3 is partially based on the first book."						0

Thomas Ligotti has built himself a nice house in that valley.<br/><br/>To summarize the thesis of this non-fiction book/treatise: being alive is <i>not</i> alright, optimists are deceiving themselves and others, the future will <i>not</i> be better, the creation of consciousness was a huge mistake, life is useless and painful to boot, and humanity would do itself a favor by collectively deciding to not have children anymore: to stop perpetuate this madness. <br/><br/>To quote:<br/><br/><blockquote>Consciousness makes it seem as if (1) there is something to do; (2) there is somewhere to go; (3) there is something to be; (4) there is someone to know. This is what makes consciousness the parent of all horrors, the thing that makes us try to do something, go somewhere, be something, and know someone, such as ourselves, so that we can escape our MALIGNANTLY USELESS being and think that being alive is all right rather than that which should not be.</blockquote> (yes, MALIGNANTLY USELESS is always capitalized)<br/><br/>or<br/><br/><blockquote><br/>Beef, pork, sometimes goat—they go into us and come out of us. This is part of the regimen of nonsense that nature forced upon us. But it is not all the nonsense we must endure as we go to and fro on the earth and walk up and down upon it. The nature nonsense, the God nonsense. How much nonsense can we take in our lives? And is there any way we can escape it? No, there is not. We are doomed to all kinds of nonsense: the pain nonsense, the nightmare nonsense, the sweat and slave nonsense, and many other shapes and sizes of insufferable nonsense. It is brought to us on a plate, and we must eat it up or face the death nonsense.<br/></blockquote><br/><br/>He quotes extensively from <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Wessel_Zapffe"">Zapffe</a>, Schopenhauer, <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philipp_Mainl%C3%A4nder"">Mainländer</a>, Lovecraft (awesome) and others to make his case - sometimes, the book feels more like an expansion of Zapffe's ideas... Neither Zapffe nor Mainländer were known to me before; I guess both are reasonably unknown, since the majority of Zapffe's work remains untranslated.<br/><br/>But: there is a dark strange form of humor at work here; reading the book I couldn't help but think that getting drunk with Ligotti must be great fun.<br/><br/>You do see that he's got a background as a horror writer:<br/><br/><blockquote>We are aberrations—beings born undead, neither one thing nor another, or two things at once … uncanny things that have nothing to do with the rest of creation, horrors that poison the world by sowing our madness everywhere we go, glutting daylight and darkness with incorporeal obscenities.</blockquote><br/><br/>Recommended for: Remember the Nietzsche quote, ""when you gaze long into an abyss the abyss also gazes into you""?

I think only hippies still believe that. It's also weird that the book so often refutes points made by Georg Groddeck and Wilhelm Reich, both of which are now mostly known for their crazy ideas and not much else (I remember a poor soul who had to hold a talk about Groddeck's ""The Book Of The It"" in high school German, to the general amusement of everyone - I mean, ""you break your leg only if you want to?"" what is <i>that</i>)<br/><br/>The second book on AIDS is better, but contains a bit of repetition from the first one (since both were published several years apart). <br/><br/><br/>Recommended for: Skeptics who want to see someone refute common beliefs of their time.

Every few pages I found a part of myself in this book, maybe because I had a similar youth as Knausgard [1] - things like the deadness of the small town he grew up in, it's weird how he writes how <i>I</i>, and a lot of other people, feel about my hometown; things like his complicated non-relationship with parents, in his case his father (who takes up most of the book, and it seems like, most of the space in Knausgard's head, too).<br/><br/>On the other hand, I can see how this might not be fun for many people - there's so much meandering going on in the book, as an example, Knausgard remembers that he used to sleepwalk and <i>bam</i>, the entire family's history of sleepwalking is described, there's no escape. So if you're looking for a logical story, you should look somewhere else - too much is happening here for that, Knausgard crams a level of detail in this that it's no wonder there are five more books, with a combined count of 3500 pags. Will I read all of these? Maybe, I got about 60 years of life left, why not.<br/><br/>Sidenote: This is how I imagine all Scandinavians are like:<br/><br/><blockquote><br/>""Mom and I have decided to separate"", he said. <br/>""What?"" I said.<br/>""Yes, but it won't affect you [.]. Besides, you're not a child anymore and in two years you'll be moving to a place of your own.""<br/>""Yes, that's true,"" I sad.<br/>""Okay?"" Dad asked.<br/>""Okay,"" I said.<br/></blockquote><br/><br/>Feelings: ¯\_(ツ)_/¯<br/><br/>[1] Well, I was way less cool - no bands, no making out at parties, more LANs, more Hohlbein books"						0

Maybe because I grew up in Germany? Do we have different childhoods? I don't think so..<br/><br/>Here we have Charlie, a highly intelligent, slightly mentally ill 15-year old (later 16) who writes letters about his daily life. Since he's so intelligent he hangs out with the older crowd, a couple of 17/18-year olds at his high-school. <br/><br/>The first half of the book was bad. Charlie doesn't think like a 15-year old, he and his friends think like mature, respectful 30-year olds. The biggest concern to me was the total and absolute lack of awkwardness, which to me is the major feeling of that certain age: most kisses at that age are ""he stuck his tongue so deep into my throat that I threw up"" [1], here kisses are beautiful and perfect moments forever stuck in time. Most social events at that age are ""she's young, she can't judge drinking, she drank so much Jägermeister in 20 minutes that she threw up on me"" [2], in this book they are gatherings of like-minded artists who read each other poetry. That is the worst part - everyone is such a unique quirky snowflake (we discuss The Smiths! We read poetry! We make punk zines! We drive pickups! We drink brandy!); no-one is really a character, everyone is just there to allude to pop culture. Of course there has to be a gay couple there as well, they're not gay because of the way the characters are but they are gay so that the book can be oh-so-progressive. It reminded me a lot of the movie Juno, where similarly everybody is quirky for quirkiness' sake.<br/><br/>The second half got better: Chbosky perfectly captures the moment when your childhood friendships dissolve and everybody starts their own life; you get nostalgic for that time. But then you realize that he knows he inflicts these emotions, you feel that he constructed this not to write ""the truth"" but to toy with your emotions, and that is when you feel like taking a shower. After I finished the book I would've given it 3 or 4 stars mainly because of these scenes; now a day later the effect has worn off, luckily. <br/><br/>On the language: Some of these one-off sentences like ""at this moment, we felt infinite"" feel painfully cheesy like Coelho, it's not even funny.<br/><br/>[1] Disclaimer: Never happened to me<br/><br/>[2] Disclaimer: Happened to me"						0

Then the book goes over to the coup d'etat by the current boss David Miscavige, details the death of Lisa McPherson and the personal role of Miscavige in it, the ""star power"" strategy of Scientology (you know, Tom Cruise, John Travolta, surprisingly to me: Nancy Cartwright, the voice of Bart Simpson), and concludes with the current rise of splinter-groups who agree with Hubbard's teaching but don't agree with how the church is handled.<br/><br/>What will make you angry is the ""evil"" (for lack of a better term) done by the church or its followers. The harassment of IRS-personnel to get a ""tax exempt"" status, the harassment of ex-members, the non-relenting suing of everyone not agreeing with Scientology, the creepiness of Hubbard and Miscavige (Hubbard had a personal staff of 15-year old girls as ""messengers"" who ran his errands for him, held his drinks, lighted his cigarettes etc. - Miscavige regularly beats people up and plays cruel mind-games, like forcing all of his staff to play ""around the world or they're 'out'"", which leads to physical fights between people for chairs), the shameful story of McPherson's death (Miscavige personally declared her ""Clear"" so a nervous breakdown should be impossible, but she suffered a nervous breakdown, since that wasn't possible they kept her under wraps and didn't give her much medical help. She died of dehydration which the church immediately started to cover up. The coroner changed her report later [it is implied under personal pressure by Scientology] so that the organization didn't get sued). So much more: The weirdness of the whole Tom Cruise-involvement is worth to read this book alone.<br/><br/>It makes you happy that Germany officially sees Scientology as a cult.<br/><br/>It was a bit discomforting to read that some of my fav. Golden Age SF writers like AE Van Vogt were early Dianetics-followers, but I expected that from the more crazier authors like Burroughs (or even guys like Manson). Also surprised to see that the Nation of Islam (Malcolm X's church for half of his life until they kicked him out, see his auto-biography) has moved closer and closer to Scientology, they're now teaching Dianetics.<br/><br/>The only positive things I took away from the book is that currently, Scientology is bleeding high-level members because Miscavige treats everyone like the complete sociopath he seems to be, and that Scientology has less members than I thought - by one count in 2008, 25,000 in the US.<br/><br/>Recommended for: those who need more proof that the most damage is done by people who think they're doing ""good"". Those who still believe in people.<br/><br/>Not recommended for: People with blood pressure problems, may induce heart attack."						0

The Outsider is alone. Wilson describes the definition and the problems of the Outsider by using literature (particularly Hesse, and a great re-interpretation of Dostoevsky's lifework) and the lives of a few Outsiders like T.E. Lawrence, van Gogh and the ballet dancer Nijinsky. To Wilson, all of these men failed at their task of 'solving' the problems of the outsider. Some committed 'mind-suicide' by turning away from these questions, some like Hesse died before they could finish their path, others like Nietzsche or Nijinsky went crazy [1], others like van Gogh killed themselves. You see, it's not an easy path.<br/><br/>The book is about 60 years old, but its main questions are still valid and as unsolved as they were back then. It seems the work on these questions died together with the counter-culture of the 70s. A few contemporary writers (such as Bret Easton Ellis or Tao Lin) touch on the themes of the Outsider's alienation, but then immediately coil back and devolve into a numbing: mindless sex, drugs, etc.<br/><br/>If you've felt yourself as an 'Outsider', then this book is for you. Wilson published it when he was just 24 [2], I believe people older than that could not have written a similar book. Maybe I just found my niche in society and stopped thinking so much about the absurdity of it all? Have I, like T. E. Lawrence, committed mind-suicide?<br/><br/>I'm not the biggest fan of his path towards a solution of these problems, which he apparently developed more in subsequent books; it's too much religion, too much mysticism for me (for example: is there a realization of the self, or is it just self-deceit, a replacement for a purpose in life? I don't even think the 'self' exists, something which Wilson sometimes touches on ['we are a collection of Is'], but then immediately goes back to assuming that the 'self' is a thing, and therefore, a 'higher' level of life is possible. I'm not really convinced that is possible in the first place.).<br/><br/>Anyway, these problems still exist, they haven't magically dissolved in clouds of logic. It's a shame that we as a society have just covered the Outsider's problems in layers of irony to pretend they don't exist (in that point, David Foster Wallace was absolutely right).<br/><br/>[1] There's an interesting anecdote in the book - when Nijinsky went crazy, he stood in the middle of the street with a cross, asking people if they had found Jesus - a man informed his wife, he had witnessed Nietzsche doing exactly the same thing 10 years before, when Nietzsche went crazy.<br/>[2] Impressive how many books, writers, ideas he cites; and for how many writers he has strong opinions (Dostoevsky, for example, is a 'shoddy craftsman'). I'm now 4 years older and I haven't even read half of these books.						0

A human is sent to one of the outer Sirian planets to stir things up. The protagonist is sent with unlimited money and advanced tech to impersonate an entire rebel army by distributing propaganda, killing people, bombing people etc. There is no moral in here since Sirians are Others and the ones he kills are always overtly characterized as being ""evil"", no ambiguity there. How he succeeds at his terrorist mission is at times fun and at times surprisingly well-thought out.<br/><br/>Without spoilering too much, the ending is actually exactly like I would imagine such a story in real life to end. No overtly heroic stuff, that was unexpected from books of the era - you would expect the guy with the chiseled chin to ride off into the sunset with the love of his life.<br/><br/>Of course, since it's Golden Age SF the protagonist is one-dimensional (feelings are boring, characters are boring, let's have more story), overpowered (unlimited money! Advanced technology!), lucky when the plot demands it etc.<br/><br/>Recommended for: Terrorists who think that blowing themselves up is ineffective and need better ideas. Friends of ""classic"" SF.

As such, I assumed I wouldn't connect with this book as I personally had no clue about what war's like, and after reading I'm pretty sure I'm not the target audience at all, but it was still so <i>interesting</i>.<br/><br/>It's a surprisingly spiritual book about how the US treats its soldiers, how soldiers see themselves and how soldiers are mistreated, based on Marlantes experiences in the Vietnam war. The book draws a lot from Joseph Campbell's stuff on myths and symbolism (Campbell appears several times in the book) but most of it you can still see as just being symbolic - just because Marlantes talks about the god Mars doesn't mean he himself believes that such a god exists, it's just his way to explain the ""inner warrior"". I guess it's geared towards the US public and towards decision makers - war is exhilarating which is a taboo to talk about, but it's also terrible to see your friends die, and for Marlantes there are simply not enough rituals inside the army and for returning veterans to help them cope in order to get back into society.<br/><br/>It's one of the more brutally honest books I've read about war.<br/><br/>The only drawbacks: sometimes the spiritualism is <i>too</i> heavy handed for me, and sometimes it falls into really antiquated gender roles (no wonder when you base it on ""gods"" or a symbol of those - fertility gods are female, war gods are male)."						0

Of course he then falls in love with the childish girl.<br/><br/>And it's fun to see how many commas fit into a sentence in German, the average must be around 8.<br/><br/>						0

It was like this:<br/><br/>here are some numbers, put them into the formula for the t-test, when the number that comes out is below 0.05 write ""I reject the Null Hypothesis with a p-value of X"". I never really learned about the basic assumptions behind this test (and all the other ones), nor did I learn about how to interpret and actually <i>think</i> about these results. Did I make mistakes in my analysis? What are possible mistakes? What could I do better? <i>What did I actually do there?</i><br/><br/>Here's a great book for exactly that set of problems - it starts off with an introduction and explanation of all the basic words and teachings of statistics (p-values, cutoffs, etc.), then goes to the basic tests (t-test, non-parametric tests, ANOVA etc.).. each method isn't introduced from the math angle, in fact the book has maybe 5 to 10 formulas, but lists the basic assumptions of the method and what you can glance from the results.<br/><br/>One caveat: Like most statisticians, Motulsky has opinions: 95% CIs are more intuitive to understand than t-tests, basing analyses on smoothed data is crap, etc. Might not be everyone's cup of tea. Motulsky also the author of the GraphPrism software for statistical analysis so that one's frequently featured (example: ""I made this analysis using Graphpad.""). To make up for that, there's an appendix on R and Excel.<br/><br/>Can a book be bad that features 4 or 5 XKCD comics? Can a book be bad when the author trawls amazon.com and writes <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/Studyguide-Intuitive-Biostatistics-Nonmathematical-Statistical/dp/1478497548"">bad reviews for fraudulent study guides</a>?

But if you want to work in stats later it might be a good decision to read through this book."						0

A lot about politics, propaganda and modern life (both haven't really changed since then it seems), the most impressive thing to me is that even though he nowadays counts as a socialist, he can impartially describe the follies of both left and right without falling for the lies and (self-)deceptions of either side. I don't know any ""modern"" (as in, currently alive) writers who can do this.<br/><br/>As a sidenote, one can find many ""famous"" formulations of Animal Farm or 1984 in these essays before they appeared in the books.<br/><br/>If you read one essay of his, choose this one: <a href=""http://alexgolec.github.io/orwell/politics"">Politics and the English Language</a>, probably the most relevant to contemporary times.<br/><br/>I've underlined about a hundred insightful passages which I'm just going to paste here so that you can get a general idea. All others can stop here.<br/><br/><br/>(Keep in mind that most of these essays are written 1938-1949)<br/><br/>It seems to me a safe assumption that the disease loosely called nationalism is now almost universal. Antisemitism is only one manifestation of nationalism, and not everyone will have the disease in that particular form. A Jew, for example, would not be antisemitic: but then many Zionist Jews seem to me to be merely antisemites turned upside-down, just as many Indians and Negroes display the normal colour prejudices in an inverted form.<br/><br/><br/>But that antisemitism will be definitively CURED, without curing the larger disease of nationalism, I do not believe.<br/><br/>Political or military commentators, like astrologers, can survive almost any mistake, because their more devoted followers do not look to them for an appraisal of the facts but for the stimulation of nationalistic loyalties.<br/><br/>In 1927 Chiang Kai Shek boiled hundreds of Communists alive, and yet within ten years he had become one of the heroes of the Left. The re-alignment of world politics had brought him into the anti-Fascist camp, and so it was felt that the boiling of the Communists ‘didn’t count’, or perhaps had not happened.<br/><br/>PACIFIST: Those who ‘abjure’ violence can only do so because others are committing violence on their behalf<br/><br/>There is no limit to the follies that can be swallowed if one is under the influence of feelings of this kind. I have heard it confidently stated, for instance, that the American troops had been brought to Europe not to fight the Germans but to crush an English revolution. One has to belong to the intelligentsia to believe things like that: no ordinary man could be such a fool.<br/><br/>If you hate and fear Russia, if you are jealous of the wealth and power of America, if you despise Jews, if you have a sentiment of inferiority towards the British ruling class, you cannot get rid of those feelings simply by taking thought. But you can at least recognise that you have them, and prevent them from contaminating your mental processes.<br/><br/>But what this scene, and much else that I saw in Germany, brought home to me was that the whole idea of revenge and punishment is a childish daydream. Properly speaking, there is no such thing as revenge. Revenge is an act which you want to commit when you are powerless and because you are powerless: as soon as the sense of impotence is removed, the desire evaporates also. Who would not have jumped for joy, in 1940, at the thought of seeing S.S. officers kicked and humiliated? But when the thing becomes possible, it is merely pathetic and disgusting. It is said that when Mussolini’s corpse<br/><br/>At the international level sport is frankly mimic warfare. But the significant thing is not the behaviour of the players but the attitude of the spectators: and, behind the spectators, of the nations who work themselves into furies over these absurd contests, and seriously believe — at any rate for short periods — that running, jumping and kicking a ball are tests of national virtue.<br/><br/>Serious sport has nothing to do with fair play. It is bound up with hatred, jealousy, boastfulness, disregard of all rules and sadistic pleasure in witnessing violence: in other words it is war minus the shooting.<br/><br/>However, it appears from President Truman’s remarks, and various comments that have been made on them, that the bomb is fantastically expensive and that its manufacture demands an enormous industrial effort, such as only three or four countries in the world are capable of making. This point is of cardinal importance, because it may mean that the discovery of the atomic bomb, so far from reversing history, will simply intensify the trends which have been apparent for a dozen years past.<br/><br/>But suppose — and really this the likeliest development — that the surviving great nations make a tacit agreement never to use the atomic bomb against one another? Suppose they only use it, or the threat of it, against people who are unable to retaliate? In that case we are back where we were before, the only difference being that power is concentrated in still fewer hands and that the outlook for subject peoples and oppressed classes is still more hopeless.<br/><br/>If you plant a walnut you are planting it for your grandchildren, and who cares a damn for his grandchildren?<br/><br/>Every writer, in any case, is rather that kind of person, but the prolonged, indiscriminate reviewing of books is a quite exceptionally thankless, irritating and exhausting job. It not only involves praising trash — though it does involve that, as I will show in a moment — but constantly INVENTING reactions towards books about which one has no spontaneous feelings whatever.<br/><br/>People talk about the horrors of war, but what weapon has man invented that even approaches in cruelty some of the commoner diseases? “Natural” death, almost by definition, means something slow, smelly and painful.<br/><br/>This business of people just dying like animals, for instance, with nobody standing by, nobody interested, the death not even noticed till the morning — this happened more than once.<br/><br/>Machiavelli and his followers taught that in politics decency simply does not exist, and, by doing so, Burnham claims, made it possible to conduct political affairs more intelligently and less oppressively. A ruling class which recognised that its real aim was to stay in power would also recognise that it would be more likely to succeed if it served the common good, and might avoid stiffening into a hereditary aristocracy.<br/><br/>Socialism, until recently, was supposed to connote political democracy, social equality and internationalism. There is not the smallest sign that any of these things is in a way to being established anywhere, and the one great country in which something described as a proletarian revolution once happened, i.e. the USSR, has moved steadily away from the old concept of a free and equal society aiming at universal human brotherhood. In an almost unbroken progress since the early days of the Revolution, liberty has been chipped away and representative institutions smothered, while inequalities have increased and nationalism and militarism have grown stronger.<br/><br/>Political predictions are usually wrong, because they are usually based on wish-thinking, but they can have symptomatic value, especially when they change abruptly.<br/><br/>Such a world-picture fits in with the American tendency to admire size for its own sake and to feel that success constitutes justification, and it fits in with the all-prevailing anti-British<br/><br/>Burnham at least has the honesty to say that Socialism isn’t coming; the others merely say that Socialism is coming, and then give the word “Socialism” a new meaning which makes nonsense of the old one.<br/><br/>If I had to make a prophecy, I should say that a continuation of the Russian policies of the last fifteen years — and internal and external policy, of course, are merely two facets of the same thing — can only lead to a war conducted with atomic bombs, which will make Hitler’s invasion look like a tea-party. But at any rate, the Russian régime will either democratise itself, or it will perish. The huge, invincible, everlasting slave empire of which Burnham appears to dream will not be established, or, if established, will not endure, because slavery is no longer a stable basis for human society.<br/><br/>The question only arises because in exploring the physical universe man has made no attempt to explore himself. Much of what goes by the name of pleasure is simply an effort to destroy consciousness.<br/><br/>This mixture of vagueness and sheer incompetence is the most marked characteristic of modern English prose, and especially of any kind of political writing. As soon as certain topics are raised, the concrete melts into the abstract and no one seems able to think of turns of speech that are not hackneyed: prose consists less and less of WORDS chosen for the sake of their meaning, and more and more of PHRASES tacked together like the sections of a prefabricated hen-house.<br/><br/>PRETENTIOUS DICTION. Words like PHENOMENON, ELEMENT, INDIVIDUAL (as noun), OBJECTIVE, CATEGORICAL, EFFECTIVE, VIRTUAL, BASIS, PRIMARY, PROMOTE, CONSTITUTE, EXHIBIT, EXPLOIT, UTILIZE, ELIMINATE, LIQUIDATE, are used to dress up simple statements and give an air of scientific impartiality to biased judgments.<br/><br/><br/>MEANINGLESS WORDS. In certain kinds of writing, particularly in art criticism and literary criticism, it is normal to come across long passages which are almost completely lacking in meaning. * Words like ROMANTIC, PLASTIC, VALUES, HUMAN, DEAD, SENTIMENTAL, NATURAL, VITALITY, as used in art criticism, are strictly meaningless, in the sense that they not only do not point to any discoverable object, but are hardly even expected to do so by the reader. When one critic writes, “The outstanding feature of Mr. X’s work is its living quality,” while another writes, “The immediately striking thing about Mr. X’s work is its peculiar deadness,” the reader accepts this as a simple difference of opinion<br/><br/>In the case of a word like DEMOCRACY, not only is there no agreed definition, but the attempt to make one is resisted from all sides. It is almost universally felt that when we call a country democratic we are praising it: consequently the defenders of every kind of régime claim that it is a democracy, and fear that they might have to stop using the word if it were tied down to any one meaning. Words of this kind are often used in a consciously dishonest way. That is, the person who uses them has his own private definition, but allows his hearer to think he means something quite different.<br/><br/>As I have tried to show, modern writing at its worst does not consist in picking out words for the sake of their meaning and inventing images in order to make the meaning clearer. It consists in gumming together long strips of words which have already been set in order by someone else, and making the results presentable by sheer humbug.<br/><br/>A scrupulous writer, in every sentence that he writes, will ask himself at least four questions, thus: What am I trying to say? What words will express it? What image or idiom will make it clearer? Is this image fresh enough to have an effect? And he will probably ask himself two more: Could I put it more shortly? Have I said anything that is avoidably ugly? But you are not obliged to go to all this trouble. You can shirk it by simply throwing your mind open and letting the ready-made phrases come crowding in.<br/><br/>When one watches some tired hack on the platform mechanically repeating the familiar phrases — BESTIAL ATROCITIES, IRON HEEL, BLOODSTAINED TYRANNY, FREE PEOPLES OF THE WORLD, STAND SHOULDER TO SHOULDER— one often has a curious feeling that one is not watching a live human being but some kind of dummy:<br/><br/>In our time, political speech and writing are largely the defense of the indefensible. Things like the continuance of British rule in India, the Russian purges and deportations, the dropping of the atom bombs on Japan, can indeed be defended, but only by arguments which are too brutal for most people to face, and which do not square with the professed aims of political parties. Thus political language has to consist largely of euphemism, question-begging and sheer cloudy vagueness. Defenseless villages are bombarded from the air, the inhabitants driven out into the countryside, the cattle machine-gunned, the huts set on fire with incendiary bullets: this is called PACIFICATION.<br/><br/>The inflated style is itself a kind of euphemism. A mass of Latin words falls upon the facts like soft snow, blurring the outlines and covering up all the details. The great enemy of clear language is insincerity. When there is a gap between one’s real and one’s declared aims, one turns, as it were instinctively, to long words and exhausted idioms, like a cuttlefish squirting out ink. In our age there is no such thing as “keeping out of politics.” All issues are political issues, and politics itself is a mass of lies, evasions, folly, hatred and schizophrenia. When the general atmosphere is bad, language must suffer. I should expect to find — this is a guess which I have not sufficient knowledge to verify — that the German, Russian and Italian languages have all deteriorated in the last ten or fifteen years as a result of dictatorship.<br/><br/>He has an extraordinarily clear prevision of the spy-haunted “police State”, with its endless heresy-hunts and treason trials, all really designed to neutralize popular discontent by changing it into war hysteria.<br/><br/><br/>If one is capable of intellectual detachment, one can PERCEIVE merit in a writer whom one deeply disagrees with, but ENJOYMENT is a different matter. Supposing that there is such a thing as good or bad art, then the goodness or badness must reside in the work of art itself — not independently of the observer, indeed, but independently of the mood of the observer. In one sense, therefore, it cannot be true that a poem is good on Monday and bad on Tuesday. But if one judges the poem by the appreciation it arouses, then it can certainly be true, because appreciation, or enjoyment, is a subjective condition which cannot be commanded.<br/><br/><br/>In Communist literature the attack on intellectual liberty is usually masked by oratory about “petty-bourgeois individualism”, “the illusions of nineteenth-century liberalism”, etc., and backed up by words of abuse such as “romantic” and “sentimental”, which, since they do not have any agreed meaning, are difficult to answer. In this way the controversy is maneuvered away from its real issue.<br/><br/>From the totalitarian point of view history is something to be created rather than learned. A totalitarian state is in effect a theocracy, and its ruling caste, in order to keep its position, has to be thought of as infallible. But since, in practice, no one is infallible, it is frequently necessary to rearrange past events in order to show that this or that mistake was not made, or that this or that imaginary triumph actually happened. Then again, every major change in policy demands a corresponding change of doctrine and a revelation of prominent historical figures.<br/><br/>There is no such thing as a genuinely non-political literature, and least of all in an age like our own, when fears, hatreds, and loyalties of a directly political kind are near to the surface of everyone’s consciousness. Even a single taboo can have an all-round crippling effect upon the mind, because there is always the danger that any thought which is freely followed up may lead to the forbidden thought. It follows that the atmosphere of totalitarianism is deadly to any kind of prose writer, though a poet, at any rate a lyric poet, might possibly find it breathable. And in any totalitarian society that survives for more than a couple of generations, it is probable that prose literature, of the kind that has existed during the past four hundred years, must actually come to an end. Literature has sometimes<br/><br/>Some, at least, of the English scientists who speak so enthusiastically of the opportunities to be enjoyed by scientists in Russia are capable of understanding this. But their reflection appears to be: “Writers are persecuted in Russia. So what? I am not a writer.” They do not see that any attack on intellectual liberty, and on the concept of objective truth, threatens in the long run every department of thought.<br/><br/>All writers are vain, selfish, and lazy, and at the very bottom of their motives there lies a mystery. Writing a book is a horrible, exhausting struggle, like a long bout of some painful illness. One would never undertake such a thing if one were not driven on by some demon whom one can neither resist nor understand.<br/><br/>One’s real reaction to a book, when one has a reaction at all, is usually “I like this book” or “I don’t like it”, and what follows is a rationalisation. But “I like this book” is not, I think, a non-literary reaction; the non-literary reaction is “This book is on my side, and therefore I must discover merits in it”.<br/><br/>To accept an orthodoxy is always to inherit unresolved contradictions. Take for instance the fact that all sensitive people are revolted by industrialism and its products, and yet are aware that the conquest of poverty and the emancipation of the working class demand not less industrialisation, but more and more. Or take the fact that certain jobs are absolutely necessary and yet are never done except under some kind of coercion. Or take the fact that it is impossible to have a positive foreign policy without having powerful armed forces. One could multiply examples. In every such case there is a conclusion which is perfectly plain but which can only be drawn if one is privately disloyal to the official ideology. The normal response is to push the question, unanswered, into a corner of one’s mind, and then continue repeating contradictory catchwords. One does not have to search far through the reviews and magazines to discover the effects of this kind of thinking.<br/><br/>To yield subjectively, not merely to a party machine, but even to a group ideology, is to destroy yourself as a writer. We feel this dilemma to be a painful one, because we see the need of engaging in politics while also seeing what a dirty, degrading business it is. And most of us still have a lingering belief that every choice, even every political choice, is between good and evil, and that if a thing is necessary it is also right. We should, I think, get rid of this belief, which belongs to the nursery. In politics one can never do more than decide which of two evils is the lesser, and there are some situations from which one can only escape by acting like a devil or a lunatic.<br/><br/>It is difficult to see how Gandhi’s methods could be applied in a country where opponents of the régime disappear in the middle of the night and are never heard of again. Without a free press and the right of assembly, it is impossible not merely to appeal to outside opinion, but to bring a mass movement into being, or even to make your intentions known to your adversary. Is there a Gandhi in Russia at this moment? And if there is, what is he accomplishing?"						0

Since the author often intersperses her own personal views and experiences working in the field the book feels more like listening to an excited relative explain his or her field at a party than a technical explanation at a conference. <br/><br/>I'm also impressed about the overall <i>niceness</i> of this book - for example, I would've found stronger words about Wolfram's research on cellular automata, which <a href=""http://vserver1.cscs.lsa.umich.edu/~crshalizi/reviews/wolfram/"">others have</a>. As a rule many of the portrayed more modern scientists seem to have an ego so big that it stands in the way of truth - i.e., their new pet theory is supposed to explain most of biology but is just an oversimplified exercise that quickly falls flat once actual data is incorporated. But again, Mitchell doesn't make fun of these models but sees them as necessary stepping stones towards a better model.<br/><br/>To summarize, <a href=""https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/766735657"">like Basti said in his review</a>, you got to love a book that brings together so many giants of different scientific disciplines."						0

KG	Paperback	565	2000	1999	2014/10/02	2013/09/30	german	german (#5)	read	"If you are not German, then there's a good chance you've never heard of Marcel Reich-Ranicki (pronounced Reich like that thing the Nazis tried to build, Ranicki like ""ranitzky""). In Germany, up until his death last year he was <i>the</i> guy for ""German high culture"" - if there was a controversial new German book, at least one TV-station would interview him. The biggest newspapers put him on the cover when he wrote a more important critique (most famously, this cover: <br/><br/><img src=""http://www.zensur-archiv.de/images/7/71/Spiegel34.jpg""><br/><br/>). With a few others he had a huge weekly TV show in which they argued about new and old books. Like all Germans, I grew up with the guy, at my parents' place there's two of the book collections he put out, each collection a case of about 20 big books with the (to Reich-Ranicki) most important German literature. In 1999 he published his autobiography, and it's great!<br/><br/>From now on spoilers.<br/><br/>Roughly split into two parts, the first one being Marcel Reich-Ranicki's youth in Poland and Berlin, then his internment in the Jewish ghetto in Warschau, how he lost his entire family to Treblinka, married his wife in the ghetto (the story of how he met her - wow) how he escaped with tons of luck, was hidden by a Polish worker, until the Soviet army invaded Poland in 1944 and he was free.<br/><br/>The second part of the book is his short work for the Polish government as a kind of Till Eulenspiegel spy who doesn't know anything about his work and receives no orders, then his disenchantment with Communist Poland, his move to Germany and his rise to become the biggest critic of German literature, publishing articles weekly, being in constant contact with all famous writers of Germany after 1945. He never even went to university, apart from high school, he was completely self-taught. Amazing.<br/><br/>The first part should interest everyone, the detached way he writes about the loss of so many people close to him kills you. The second part is probably only of interest to Germans, or those who are into modern German literature. People like Günter Grass, Anna Seghers (great story about Reich-Ranicki realizing that she didn't understand her own work), Wolfgang Koeppen, Golo Mann, Stefan Fest and more make up the bulk of this part (how cool was Wolfgang Koeppen?), and if these names don't tell you anything, then the second part will bore you.<br/><br/>There is however a great, short anecdote in that part in which Joachim Fest invited Albert Speer (""Hitler's architect"" and close associate, free after 15 years of prison) and Reich-Ranicki to the same book release and it's a small miracle Reich-Ranicki didn't murder Speer on the spot. I might have.<br/><br/>Throughout both parts the love for literature and music abounds, full of quotes, so this book is a treat for fans of literature. I read through the 500+ pages in one or two days. Last month a new collection of older essays on German literature was published in Germany, can't wait to read it.<br/><br/>Not recommended for: If you're not into books, you'll probably be bored.

There's a woman trying to understand a conspiracy that may not exist in the first place. <br/><br/>There are jokes about the long development time of Daikatana, nitpicky dialogues about random vs. pseudo-random numbers, Ghost In The Shell quotes, murders, a strip-club called ""Joie de Beavre"", a professional Nose (i.e., a private investigator who works only with smells), and of course, nothing is ever really resolved, and paranoia is the basic form of consciousness. <br/><br/>Impressive that Pynchon, who certainly doesn't count as a ""digital native"" - at the time of Bleeding Edge's writing, he was about 75 years old - is the first one who can actually write a good novel about the Internet. Neuromancer hasn't aged well, Ready Player One is more concerned with cramming 80s references, some pretend to be about the Internet but are actually about the thing you watched when Angelina Jolie logged into a server in the movie Hackers (like Mankell's Firewall). When Pynchon mentions Back Orifice and Netbus I get nostalgic for my script kiddie days.<br/><br/>Of course not all references make sense, for example, the Daikatana joke - the game actually was released about a year before the novel takes place. But then again, who wants to know?<br/><br/>Recommended for: Fans of fun, the Internet, post-modern books making fun of post-modern books. Fans of The Crying Of Lot 49, I feel like both books are a bit more ""Pynchon light"", i.e., they are easier to follow.<br/> <br/>Not recommended for: People who need a clean, straight-cut story with all of their story-lines resolved."						0

To me, he often writes ""too technical"" since he knows so much about literature and writing that he easily can switch, and try to advance, different writing styles. However, in this ""advancing"" the stories often loose their blood; reading them turns into a non-trivial technical exercise instead of fun.<br/><br/>Having said that, the titular interviews are still really good, mostly because these are pure dialogue without any über-stilted elements. It's a little bit like reading through /r/redpill, except that this one is fiction (and thus allows the horror to be replaced by ""mere"" amusement [haha I wish]). Even the strange logic is there, full of the usual biologisms and false equivalences...<br/><br/>Recommended for: people who're not constantly on the Internet and should learn that hellalotta people are creeps with weird reasoning"						0

Sagan is certainly no poet, the language in this book is concise and to the point - no flowery similes, no poetic parts, it's pure story (and large parts of the story don't even have protagonists, it's just descriptions of what's going on internationally).<br/><br/>Sagan's experience on government bodies is clearly showing in this book, it's surprisingly heavy on international, science and office politics. A bit funny that in this book, the Soviet Union still exists in 1999. <br/><br/>The biggest spot of bother is the ending. It's a weird, vague thing - of course, a human author who tries to describe a species that far surpasses humans in every aspect can only fail. Sagan found a nice way to sneak out of that dilemma, but then he destroys it by having the main character find a message in Pi, just like that? I mean, people have been automatically computing Pi for decades now, it feels illogical that the main character can do that on her own.						0

Transcripts of recordings of a few lectures on English literature Borges gave in the 1960s in Buenos Aires, before he was internationally famous, which is why the recordings of these lectures don't exist anymore.<br/><br/>Interestingly, it's very conversational in tone, there's very little university related talking going on (of course, there is a possibility that the editors cut this) - Borges talks only once about tests, never again about anything but Anglo-Saxon/English literature; he seems to be more concerned about recommending books students should read instead of drilling tidbits of knowledge into them for tests. That's another amazing thing about these lectures; Borges was already mostly blind, everything he quotes (for some reason in Spanish) is from memory, all years and all facts are from his head, which is why he so often gets students to read longer poems to the class for him.<br/><br/>But, if you're looking for Borges as a builder of mysterious worlds, you won't find him here; these are introductory lectures, there's very little interpretation, more often than not Borges is more concerned with how fun the story is and how beautiful the language sounds than he bothers with explaining, as an example, the political background of why a certain writer wrote this poem. <br/><br/>Sometimes it's strange in that he gets a student to read a poem in English, then summarizes the story in the middle of the poem (remember, the students are young and probably didn't know much English yet), then lets the student read the rest of the poem, and at that point you would have expected Borges to talk some more about what they just read, focus on single elements and interpret them, but he just has the student read the next poem. Another curious thing is the choice of authors by Borges - there's only a single page on Shakespeare, but an entire lecture on Stevenson.<br/><br/>Recommended for: People who are looking for an introduction to English literature, or those who need more books on their to-read shelf<br/><br/>Not recommended for: People who want to see a blind man construct a library containing every possible book						0

Of course, he can't pass the chance to criticize modern Christianity himself:<br/><br/><blockquote><br/>Christianity long ago shifted from the side of the poor and dispossessed to that of the rich and aggressive. The liberal Establishment really has little to fear from it and everything to gain. For the most part, it has become the creed of the suburban well-to-do, not the astonishing promise offered to the riffraff and undercover anticolonial militants with whom Jesus himself hung out.<br/></blockquote><br/> <br/>Eagleton is a well-read writer full of wit, and it be great to listen to Eagleton speak.<br/><br/>It gets a bit weird once Eagleton goes all ""religion is not the modern problem, capitalism is!!! Now let's all talk about how great socialism is!"", but I think that is to be expected with his writing. It's similar in ""On Evil"" towards the end.<br/><br/>Fun quote:<br/><br/><blockquote><br/>The New Testament is a brutal destroyer of human illusions.

However, this book is impossible to finish.<br/><br/>The story: A human, after he grew up with the elves, is returned to humankind. Mankind's society is alien to him but lucky for him the Elves taught him magic, for example, he can make people and things vanish with the power of this thoughts.<br/><br/>No wait, that was wrong.<br/><br/>The story: A human, after he grew up with the martians, is returned to humankind. Mankind's society is alien to him but lucky for him the Martians taught him special powers, for example, he can make people and things vanish with the power of this thoughts.<br/><br/>Yes, that's more like it. As you can see, I don't think this book is much science fiction: yes, it has spaceships, but no, it doesn't have the <i>great ideas</i> of science-fiction. All this offers is fantasy's escapism, and Heinlein's crude ideas, his own imitation of science-fiction's <i>ideas</i>.<br/><br/>Oh, the ideas: It seems that every time Heinlein had an idea he had to write an SF-book about the idea, explaining why it's the greatest idea ever and every body should follow it.<br/><br/>Starship Troopers? ""Military dictatorship is the best thing, here's half a book of lectures on the topic with some fight scenes in between.""<br/><br/>The Moon Is A Harsh Mistress? ""Libertarianism is best, here's half a book of lectures with some fight scenes in between.""<br/><br/>And this one, Stranger In A Strange Land? ""Polygamy is best, here's a science-fiction book with the latter half being lectures."" To be precise, this book is more about polygyny, and of course only heterosexual!<br/><br/>The women in this book seem to fail the Bechdel test: one of the main protagonists of this book is female and I swear 99% of her thoughts are either about the Man From Mars or about her fiancee. She doesn't seem to have her own motivations, which goes for the other female characters, as well.<br/><br/>And then the writing and plotting - Heinlein seems to be the king of the overpowered Deus Ex Machina, having the Man From Mars always learn new magic tricks when the situation calls for it. The protagonists always have the upper hand, they're never truly in danger. Are they being attacked? Shazam, The Man Form Mars can ""wish"" people away. Is the Man From Mars stuck somewhere? Abracadabra, he can leave his body and, I don't know, ""walk on the astral plane""? That's how Doctor Strange does it. The Moon Is A Harsh Mistress does this as well, by the way - the protagonists have that massively overpowered, invincible AI on their side. In gaming terms: Heinlein is the king of buffing.<br/><br/>So yeah, I can't understand how and why people love Heinlein so much - I guess its an overhang from their childhoods (which also explains why everybody loves the infantile Enders Game so much).<br/><br/>tl;dr avoid!"						0

If you need information on him, here's an excerpt from Penn & Teller, including a short interview with Borlaug: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cEBtO25xW-o (NSFW language). In a nutshell, he developed wheat-varieties with extremely high yield, raised Mexico from a poor wheat-importing country to a wheat-exporting country, and prevented famines in India, Pakistan and China.<br/> <br/>Makes for some interesting thoughts on the current GMO-debate (did you know hybrid seeds in the 1930s were not allowed to be re-sold?), mostly because people are now acting the same way they did towards Borlaug's hybrid seeds in the 60s (""it's unnatural"", ""we're too dependent on modern methods"", ""traditional plants go into extinction"" etc.). Especially in the beginning is the writing a bit weird (Quote: ""Contemplating those events upstairs was super scary""), thus the 4 stars.<br/><br/>It's also interesting that Borlaug was able to give seeds of new hybrids away basically for free since he was funded mostly by the Rockefeller Foundation. Good to know that the Foundation is involved in the development of Golden Rice (which is available for free too for developing countries). <br/><br/>Plus it's only $3 on Kindle, so there's that.<br/><br/>Recommended for: Anyone who needs some inspiration on what one person can achieve in their life."						0

Only in the last ~10% of the book does the story pick up and things actually happen, before that it's just ""and then the party had to go over there because that's where I, Larry, imagined that other cool thing I wanted to describe"".<br/><br/>I've read that this book is ""hard sci-fi"", as in, ""the things happening in this book are based on valid science"". This is only true for parts of the book, mainly the descriptions and basics of the ringworld. The biology, on the other hand, is absolutely bonkers. Not only does Riven describe natural selection as ""survival of the strongest"" [2], you also (Spoiler!) have a race breeding humans for <i>luck</i>, and the description of why this works boils down to ""fate"" (as in: ""her luck wanted her to be stranded here""). <br/><br/>And just like Star Trek the aliens are not very imaginative either - here again the entire species has just one culture, just one language, just one ""look"". If we ever meet aliens that will be far from the truth (consider us humans - you drive for 1 hour in Europe and you already meet a different culture, language etc.).<br/><br/>2 stars, but only because of the ringworld.<br/><br/>Recommended for: fans of science-fiction.

In reality, natural selection is about ""survival of the fittest"" in which ""fitness"" does not mean strength, but reproductive success. Consider two brothers: One is relatively weak but sexually mature at age 10, the other one is stronger but needs more time to sexually mature since his body had to invest resources into strength, let's say he matures by 15. Both die at 20. Who can have more children? <br/><br/>"						0

In this case of Mullis' autobiography, or rather loose collection of essays, I wanted to do exactly that about 5 times - it has been a long time since I've been this physically angry at a book.<br/><br/>The first quarter of the book is alright - he details how he perfected PCR, how he got the Nobel Prize for that, etc. The one thing  that starts to annoy is his constant drive to portray himself as such an unconventional person - ""Hey everybody, I go to strip-clubs! I'm OK with drugs!

Why he then goes and throws everything out of the window is beyond me - I think it's because he loves being in a position opposite to the mainstream, even if that means distorting and twisting the truth until it becomes a lie.<br/><br/>First, the chapter about his belief in astrology - his evidence that it exists: 3 people guessed his star-sign. Also, a program used the constellation of planets at his birth to describe his character, and I quote: ""Most of the things that the fifty-page document said about me were correct. But some of them were entirely wrong."" (p. 118). Guess what, that's how horoscopes are written! Make them so vague and general that ""most of the things"" are correct! It doesn't take a scientist to notice that, yet Mullis constantly assures us that he's a scientist. Literally: ""I am a scientist"", at least 3 or 4 times in the book.<br/><br/>Then it gets worse and he ""goes full retard"" (Tropic Thunder, 2008), in his views on global warming: ""What is the trouble with something being out of balance if the natural state of that thing is change?"" (p94).  He then goes on:  ""The concept that human beings are capable of causing the planet to overheat or lose its ozone seems about as ridiculous as blaming the Magdalenian paintings for the last ice age"" (p 96). That's his entire rhetoric - he doesn't cite any proof to the contrary, he just does his impression of Rush Limbaugh. That's it!<br/><br/>We humans can and have changed this planet massively, starting with ""small things"" like the artificial Suez Canal, to changing the entire picture of earth at night. We got enough weapons to irradiate and destroy the surface of the earth. And of course the state of earth is change, the problem we humans might get is that this change might wipe us out. He conveniently doesn't mention this - it doesn't fit his story.<br/><br/>The chapter that made me truly angry is the one where he starts to deny the HIV->AIDS causality, and that's when he gets so self-satisfied and the smugness just oozes out of the pages, into your lap, forcing you to take a shower. He says that the presence of HIV-antibodies shows that HIV has been defeated: ""Antibodies signaled that the virus had been defeated. The patient had saved himself."" (p 139). That's like saying that the presence of soldiers shows that there is no war. <br/><br/>This shows that he either doesn't know a thing about the human immune system or he outright lies to save his worldview, I don't know if Wikipedia was very big in 1998, but a look into an encyclopedia could have certainly helped him. And then he goes in and does these absolutely dirty tricks: ""They didn't show that everybody with the antibodies had the disease. In fact, they found some healthy people with antibodies."" (p 139). That is so dishonest that I'm getting angry again just typing this - it takes <i>time</i> for the symptoms of a disease to develop [2]. <br/><br/>He goes into his descriptions of some of the major players of the early HIV ""controversy"", notably Gallo and Duesberg. He uses language again to make one look good and one look bad: ""In spite of his lack of luster as a scientist, Gallo had worked his way up in the power structure. Peter Duesberg, despite his brilliance, worked his way down"" (p 142). Peter Duesberg is one of the biggest douchebags in recent history, and one of the first HIV-denialists. He used to be the editor at PNAS and used that status to circumvent peer-review for one of his denialist articles, something which Muller describes this way: ""Duesberg pointed out wisely from the sidelines in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Science that there was no good evidence implicating the new virus."" (p 143). He again conveniently doesn't mention that Duesberg used his (former) status to get his article into PNAS. He also ignores the HIV-AIDS evidence that was already available in 1998, most disingenuous by saying that ""no-one had proven that HIV causes AIDS"". The problem with proving that is that you have to literally infect a human with HIV, something which no ethics committee in the world will approve. But there are some cases from before the publication of this book which Mullis could have had a look at.<br/><br/>There's the Florida dentist case from 1990, in which a dentist unknowingly infected some of his patients, who were all tested positive for HIV and later died of AIDS, same as the dentist, Wikipedia has an overview: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kimberly_Bergalis This case was the first case in which someone proved that HIV causes AIDS, something which Mullis conveniently forgets. That was 8 years before this book! Another big case was when three lab workers got infected with HIV and developed AIDS, that was in 1997, maybe too close to the publication of this book (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9045880). There's a mountain of evidence for the causality HIV->AIDS, but Mullis always pretends as if he's the lone warrior showing the world that ""the big pharma-companies"" just want to make money with the disease of others. See here for evidence: http://www.niaid.nih.gov/topics/HIVAIDS/Understanding/howHIVCausesAIDS/Pages/HIVcausesAIDS.aspx<br/> <br/>By the way: after the publication of this book, Duesberg became a member of the advisory panel to Thabo Mbeki in South Africa, and his denialism prevented the use of antiretroviral drugs, one of the main reasons why AIDS spread so much leading to literally hundreds of thousands who died of AIDS in South Africa. That man has <i>a lot</i> of blood on his hand! (Check Wikipedia: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Duesberg)<br/><br/>And then, the prime piece, the one that made me throw my Kindle across the room, the most disgusting sentence I've read all year: ""If a person has three hundred sexual contact a year - with people who themselves are having three hundred contacts a year - that's ninety thousand times more opportunity for infections than a person involved in an exclusive relationship"". (p 146) YES IT'S THEIR OWN FAULT THAT THEY HAVE AIDS. THESE DISGUSTING PIGS AND THEIR FILTHY POLYGAMY!! [3] LET'S ALL SHAME MORE VICTIMS. Edit: According to the WHO, 2% of the 8 million children who die per year die because of AIDS. Did these have too much sex too? (Source: http://www.who.int/pmnch/media/press_materials/fs/fs_mdg4_childmortality/en/index.html)<br/><br/>Does he cite peer-reviewed publications for any of his viewpoints? In one chapter he makes fun of a nutritionist for not citing any sources in her ""crusade"" against margarine, and writes that you should always cite sources. Yet there <i>isn't a single paper cited</i> in this book, a thing you would think a scientist would do.<br/><br/><br/>Of course, there are the other crazy things [4] I don't want to go into because to him, they happened, and I can't criticize that. There's a lot more going on in this book that for the purpose of my sanity I will now forget so I can't write about it here.<br/><br/>The only thing you'll learn in this book is that you shouldn't trust people just because they got a prize, even if it's the Nobel Prize. <br/><br/>[1] Apparently the official title is ""chief wife""? http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emperor_of_Japan<br/><br/>[2] especially in HIV that can take up to 3 months, in some cases several years: http://aids.gov/hiv-aids-basics/hiv-aids-101/signs-and-symptoms/<br/><br/>[3] capslock is cruise control for rage<br/><br/>[4] Glowing raccoons abducting him over night. Someone saving him from a laughing gas overdose via astral travelling. His telepathy with a friend. That said friend's face morphing into other faces, even though Mullis was sober. etc.<br/>"						0

Eagleton is a literary theorist and a Marxist and it clearly shows. For him, evil is caused by institutions that make normally ""ok"" people do evil things. He doesn't really support this with studies or any numbers, he rather shows characters from literature as examples for his conclusions, or points to the Nazis. Whether you like that or not is up to you, I think ""hard"" scientists will be annoyed[1]. His writing, however, is beautiful and so <i>British</i>:<br/><br/><blockquote><br/>Perhaps children murder each other all the time and are simply keeping quiet about it [...]. Perhaps this is because we are ready to believe all kinds of sinister things about children, since they seem like a halfalien race in our midst. Since they do not work, it is not clear what they are for. <br/></blockquote><br/><br/>(p. 4)<br/><br/>or wisely on p. 117, the last page:<br/><br/><blockquote><br/>But there is a difference between regretting this tragically lost opportunity, and treating one's enemies as mindless beasts whom no rational action could ever conceivably sway. For champions of this viewpoint, the only solution to terrorist violence is more violence. More violence then breeds more terror, which in turn puts more blameless lives at risk. The result of defining terrorism as evil is to exacerbate the problem; and to make the problem worse is to be complicit, however unwittingly, in the very barbarism you condemn.<br/></blockquote><br/><br/><br/>[1] I personally would have at least included the case-study of the murdering necrophiliac homosexual duck to show that ""evil"" in the form of senseless violence exists in nature too: C.W. Moeliker (2001). ""The first case of homosexual necrophilia in the Anas platyrhynchos (Aves:Anatidae)"". Deinsea - Annual of the Natural History Museum Rotterdam 8: 243–247. "						0

Sometimes, entire pages seem to have been machine-translated from German, to which Feyerabend added Greek and Latin quotes, and cites ten different philosophers and forgotten authors to make the confusion complete. I had to look up quite a few English words (incommensurable, counter-inductive, etc.). But then suddenly, the next 5 pages are crystal clear and genius! <br/><br/>To summarize his points: Scientific conduct and progress is much more chaotic and ""law-less"" than proponents and practitioners of science realize. He makes his point by showing how Galileo didn't win Europe over to Copernicanism by showing a theory that explained reality ""better"" (as one would assume), Galileo won everyone over by inventing a few tools, hiding a few inconvenient datapoints, being a good propagandist, and a lot of trickery.<br/><br/>For me as a scientist reading Against Method is freeing. There is a break in between how we do science and how we present it to the public - for example, the structure of a scientific publiction has absolutely nothing to do with how the actual results were obtained. In my case with bioinformatics, I start to play around with data, and walk down 500 paths of which 499 don't work. I get some interesting results, and try to make sense of them by looking through the literature, and I finally find some biological phenomenon that might fit. Using that phenomenon as a start, I think how I can prove or disprove it - find one way to prove it - and write the paper. This has nothing to do with the scientific method of hypothesis -> prediction -> testing with data, yet the publication I write follows this structure (I also do not list the 499 things I tried, thereby ""inventing"" a story that is cleaner than reality). <a href=""http://www.phdcomics.com/comics/archive.php?comicid=761"">PHDComics had this fitting comic a few years ago</a>.<br/><br/>Feyerabend correctly sees that stringent application of the ""rules"" of science would make science impossible. For example, if falsification were to be applied stringently we simply couldn't have bioinformatics. Play around with one of the settings in your genome assembler, and you get a slightly different genome - which one is the correct one? If I computationally predict genes in a genome, I get around 400,000 genes. Which ones do really exist? <br/><br/>There are surely ways to falsify this, but the technology does not exist (or it's a tedious, expensive and literally life-consuming work). As long as the technology does not exist, we proceed and publish: ""anything goes"". This makes science much more a field of play than people realize. Schools do not teach this: according to what I learned in high school about science, I should be much more stuffy and strict. Yet a large part of my work is playing around in an R console, looking for fun things, making pretty pictures, and drinking free coffee.<br/><br/>Where I don't agree with Feyerabend in the slightest is his demand to split science from politics - I can understand where he's coming from, I guess up until the 80s the results of science where set in stone. What the scientist said was ""true"", to the detriment of science itself; Feyerabend says that there are other systems alternative to science that are as good as, or even ""better"" than ""Western science"" - he makes the case for traditional Chinese science & medicine, which by now is known to be mostly Placebo effect. I can't agree with him at all. The split of science and politics has (partially?) caused the mess we're in now.<br/><br/>Maybe by now, statistics has done the job Feyerabend wanted other systems to do. The introduction of rigid tests, the spreading awareness of problems like the multiple comparisons problem, too small sample sizes and more, the availability of online anonymous comments etc., has helped to ""dethrone"" scientific results. <br/><br/>I also can understand why scientists rarely read philosopy of science. Large parts of this book serve as counter-arguments to Popper and Lakatos, I rarely understood anything there, since I've read very little philosophy of science.. Plus I, like most scientists, don't understand Latin or Greek.<br/><br/>Recommended for: Practitioners and ""fans"" of science, it's eye-opening.<br/>"						0

Since then, I've jumped through most of the hoops society has laid out for budding scientists, and at some point in the next 2 years I should be allowed to call myself a ""Doctor of Philosophy"" or something like that (""burger flipper""?). It has come obvious to me that there's a ton of problems in scientific research, in the scientific community, and in the way research is conducted. It's also very funny to see that a lot of these problems have already been described in this book from 27 years ago. <br/><br/>Basically, it's a collection of essays in the style of Marxist dialectics, i.e., a way of thinking that tries to incorporate entire systems instead of first trying to split a system into its parts and then analyzing these (the Cartesian approach). I'm pretty sure Dialectics has been re-invented as Systems Thinking in recent years by writers like Donna Meadows, even the way the graphs work is mostly identical.<br/><br/>Some interesting points, in no particular order:<br/>- Evolutionary research tries to see the organism as the outcome of evolution, while Levis/Lewontin try to show that organisms also shape their own evolution (for starters, all species shape their environments, starting from their droppings to more complicated things like building nests/burrrows/dams/houses, and much much more).<br/>- Gene/phenotype studies usually model the interaction between both as a one-way, one-to-one interaction, at one point in time, while there's a world outside this small scale which easily falsifies any results. Much of this is currently repeated in criticisms of Genome-wide association studies (GWAS).<br/>- Evolution as a theory is a product of the society it was invented in. It couldn't have been proposed in a stale, ""God-given"" medieval society.<br/>- I didn't realize before how much of Darwin's thinking was shaped by Malthus.<br/>- The Essay on Lysenkoism has some weird points, like that table showing that during the rise and acceptance of Lysenkoism in the Soviet Union, yield grew and was a bit higher than in the US, and that's taken as a minor defense of Lysenkoism. However, just because yield grew doesn't mean that Lysenkoism was good - there could have been millions of reasons why that happened.<br/>- Not sure why the essay on health in the Latin American community is there; it's way too specialized to be of any interest<br/>- I'm pretty sure that each essay is a hidden angry rant about a recent publication, but since these essays are all fairly old (end 70s to mid 80s) I don't know the publication in question.<br/>- If you're a biologist, skip the first two essays, these are basically modified long dictionary entries showing the current state of evolution and biology. There's a lot in there you've heard before.<br/>- ""The Commodization of Science"" is awesome, a critique of (Western) science as a tool of capitalist expansion, def. recommended (you don't have to agree)<br/><br/>Of course, one can criticize Dialectic approaches as a bit far-strung - it's complicated enough to just look at a one-to-one interaction at one point in time, and success in this can already take a long time (easily more than a normal PhD takes). Analyzing the entire system at once makes things only ""worse"", so to speak. The statistical tools we now (2013) have developed for these ""simple"" interactions are already so complicated that I shudder to think what ""proper"" modelling of a complex system needs.<br/><br/>On the writing: Levins/Lewontin seem to be big fans of the needlessly endless sentence. Definitely no ""pop science"" material!<br/><br/>Anyway, if you're a biologist and you want a very different view on your science, go for it. Similar goes for the interested layman. If, however, you're looking for a fun book you can read on your commute, stay away, for that it's too dry. "						0

Along the way he learns the memory tricks that are mostly based on the Greeks' work but are still widely in use today, and uses the opportunity to write about the history of memory, some extremely interesting edge cases (like the guy who inspired Rainman), some of the science behind remembering, how these techniques are having a small renaissance in teaching, and why it is that we can remember some things better than others (for example, spatial memories are easier and faster to remember than numbers). You'll learn that memory champions are not hyper-intelligent <i>savants</i>, but are just people who are well-trained in a specific set of tricks, similar to good magicians (a comparison Foer repeats at least 3 times).<br/><br/>Of course, reading this book won't turn you into a all-remembering memory beast, for these tricks require too much initial work - for example, to remember a deck of cards you first have to remember a vibrant (if possible raunchy) image to connect the card to, so you don't have to remember the card itself, only the image. Coming up with these images in the first place, and subsequently learning them for an entire deck of cards, already takes several days to weeks. And then you're in possession of one of the more useless tricks in the world, congratulations.<br/><br/>And of course, there's one small story at the end to prove that when you're the memory champion you don't have to have a good memory: When Foer returns from the US championship, he drives his car to a restaurant to have dinner with friends. Later he returns home by tram, only to realize at home that he forgot he had a car.<br/><br/>Recommended for: People who always wondered what it would be like to know more than 3 digits of Pi.

Of course, later I had Quake and Doom... and once I had a state-of-the-art 3dfx Voodoo 3 graphics card I could even play Half-Life! (or rather, Counter-Strike Beta 4). As you can see, this book makes you nostalgic.<br/><br/>The book stops somewhere around the release of Doom 3, and on a positive note. But it's fun to see that the ""tinkerer""-side of Carmack, someone who was always trying to be on the forefront of graphical development, is still going strong - he recently became CTO of Oculus, a company that creates new virtual reality helmets.<br/><br/>The only minor annoyance to me is a bit unfair towards the book: since I now developed a bit of a fancy for algorithms, it would have been nice to read more about these, or even how Carmack was able to keep up to date with what research was pumping out in his field (the book glances over technical details for better readability).<br/><br/>I guess there are two camps as the audience of this book - one is people who grew up with PC-gaming in the 90s, and the other is people who are into startup-stories or business stories in general; I guess some cautionary tales can be learned from id software's terrible atmosphere and Ion Storm's failure."						0
14185	The Three Stigmata of Palmer Eldritch	Philip K.

The antagonist (?) Palmer Eldritch becomes some sort of demi-God for all those partaking in his drug Chew-Z - users are transported to some kind of shared mass-fantasy in which Palmer Eldritch appears. In a way, <i>The Three Stigmata</i> is a lot like PKD's <i>VALIS</i> - it's interesting to read  and at some point it's tripping balls, but you also lose the sense of what on earth's going on.						0

If I ever wind up teaching at a university (stranger things have happened) I will be ""borrowring"" from the appendix of this book with useful templates for feedback etc., and I will have to re-read the entire book, again. It's not that long anyway.<br/><br/>Reading through the chapters I couldn't help but be reminded of my terrible high school years and how the teachers seemed to have actively tried to do everything wrong, with no feedback, one big evaluation at the end of the year instead of small ones, terrible classroom atmosphere, no defined goal of learning, no rubrics, and on and on and on.<br/><br/>I would love to read the same book, but with a different target audience - a book that takes all this peer-reviewed, published and established knowledge about learning and bundles it into a manual on how to learn and study ""the best"" way(s). It would have helped tremendeously in my high school and university years.<br/><br/>Recommended for: Those who teach, and those who like to learn by themselves and would like to learn more efficiently."						0

They're meant to exhibit the advanced usage of the main focus of the current chapter, but they so often do something exceedingly clever that you first have to go through the code step by step with a piece of paper to understand the basic algorithm. Only then can you go on and understand the usage of the data-structure or control-structure in question.<br/>2) It can't decide whether it's an introduction or a reference. The book is written and structured like an introduction, but it seems to be on a quest to introduce the majority of standard functions that R has (and they are legion). I'm pretty sure I already forgot about 80% of the introduced functions."						0

The only qualm I have is that the author, Frank Brady, has a personal connection to Fischer from Fischer's late childhood on and was deeply impressed by Fischer. <br/><br/>As such, Brady is constantly trying to improve Fischer's image and sometimes he's just trying too hard - for example, in the match Reshevsky v. Fischer (the ""Match of the Century""). Due to one of the sponsors of the match having different obligations the organizers moved the start of the match a couple of hours earlier, and Fischer just wouldn't have that. He simply didn't show up to the game and thus lost it. How does Brady describe it?<br/><br/><blockquote><br/>... the ""Match of the Century"", as it had been billed, was the unfortunate casualty of Bobby's ingrained sleep habits and the long shadow of patronage in chess.<br/></blockquote> (p. 164)<br/><br/>No, it was a casualty of Fischer being an arrogant brat!<br/><br/>Anyway, I'd still recommend it, it shows that a) behind a ""genius"" is a mountain of lonely hard work (I guess ""geniuses"" don't really exist?), and b) it's always entertaining to read about douchebags.<br/><br/>P.S.: There's also an interesting connection to the ongoing Snowden-case: When an elderly Fischer was arrested in Japan for being there illegally (his passport was revoked by the US because Fischer committed the crime of playing in the embargoed communist Yugoslavia about 10 years earlier) Iceland made Fischer an Icelandic citizen so that Japan didn't have to extradite Fischer to the US. I guess this is why so many people look to Iceland to help Snowden? But on the other hand, Fischer had prior connections to Iceland - he was seen as something of a national hero since he held a tournament in Iceland some twenty years earlier, which made Iceland internationally known. Snowden does not have any such connection."						0

His descriptions and experiences living on the absolute bottom of society is where his political leanings were born - I think this is also where parts of Animal Farm and 1984 come from. <br/><br/>The book is on Gutenberg, but the <a href=""http://ebooks.adelaide.edu.au/o/orwell/george/o79d/"">ebooks@Adelaide version</a> is slightly nicer, although there's about 10-15 scanning errors."						0

Onoda was trained in guerilla warfare by the Japanese army and had been sent to a small island in the Philippines to fight the war against the Americans. Unusual for Japanese soldiers, he had been explicitly forbidden from committing suicide and had been allowed to be captured. His orders were to cause mayhem until the Japanese army would sent explicit orders or would come to pick him up. That never happened, so he stayed for 30 years until a student found him in 1974.<br/><br/>The book becomes most interesting when he describes his mental acrobatics to keep on fighting - other Japanese often came looking for him, dropped leaflets on the island, called for him via speakers, but he always found some minor mistake or flaw to convince him that these people were impostors sent by the enemy to trap him. Newspapers saying that the war was lost with pictures of Japanese in their cities were obvious fakes - if Japan had lost, all Japanese people, including children and women, would have died fighting! It didn't really help either that the Philippine army used the island to train bombing runs (<i>genius</i> idea - train where you know that there are still guerillas hiding) - what would you think if you were stuck in an imagined war, but the planes dropping bombs were real? <br/><br/>He never got the official order to stand down, so he never stopped fighting, which he did by terrorizing the poor islanders, burning their rice, shooting at them, stealing from them.<br/><br/>Sadly, the autobiography is slightly insincere. Onoda describes shooting in the general direction of people and never mentions whether he actually hit someone, but <a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hiroo_Onoda'>Wikipedia</a> says he killed several islanders.<br/><br/>Onoda died just 5 months ago. This book seems to have been forgotten since it came out in the 70s - I got it for a dollar at the Lifeline bookfest.<br/><br/>Recommended for: 1) People who are into survivor manuals. Want to know how to store ammunition in the jungle? Collect the bullets in a glass bottle, put coconut oil on the bullet to prevent rusting, close the bottle with a steel cap to prevent rats from eating the coconut oil! <i>You're welcome!</i> (The book has helpful drawings too)<br/>2) People interested in reading about how your psychology can bend your reality<br/>						0

It's all about Campbell's lifework, which was to compare different mythologies of different cultures and continents and find all the overlapping tropes - and there's lots to be found.<br/><br/>This book shines when Campbell starts to tell all these stories from Native Americans, Inuit, Hindus and Buddhists and shows how they share common motifs and how they are essentially just one big story. It's also great when he criticizes Christianity:<br/><br/><blockquote>Moyers: In the Christian story the serpent is the seducer.<br/><br/>Campbell: That amounts to a refusal to affirm life.</blockquote><br/><br/>I would've given it five stars were it not for Campbell continuously accepting stories as fact, for example:<br/><br/><blockquote>There's a Czechoslovakian psychiatrist, Stanislav Grof, now living in California, who for years treated people with LSD. And he found that some of them re-experienced birth [...]. Isn't it amazing that this repeats just what the myth says?</blockquote><br/><br/>Now Campbell hints here that this is an event re-experiencing something that actually happens, when in reality, it might just have been the drug, no experience necessary. He likes to do this - he often goes out on a leg and states things he can't prove. My biggest peeve is with his central statement of ""Follow your bliss"" - that there's something roughly akin to destiny that is manifested in the things you like. So to be happy you follow that path of your preferences and that is the only way. It's a bit of an unfair thing - if your circumstances prohibit you from following bliss, what then?<br/><br/>He's a bit unfair in other parts, too:<br/><blockquote>Freud tells us to blame our parents for all the shortcomings of our life, and Marx tells us to blame the upper class of our society. But the only one to blame is oneself. That's the helpful thing about the Indian idea of karma. Your life is the fruit of your own doing. You have no one to blame but yourself.</blockquote> - says the Upper Middle Class white guy who could afford to go to university.<br/><br/>Nonetheless, I learned a lot about myths and it was a pleasure reading. It's great when he compares the motifs in Star Wars 4-6 to mythological motifs - and they constantly come back to it! He would've hated Episode 1.<br/><br/>Recommended for: People who get stuck browsing TVTropes.<br/><br/>Not recommended for: People not interested in the fabrics of society"						0

When there is a quote from an political opponent or from a newspaper, it's about Lincoln. In a way, that's good - I can't remember more than five names at once, anyway.<br/><br/>It's a relatively thick, very detailed book, but it's never truly dry and boring - rather, the myriads of quoted contemporary sources (newspaper comments, entries from diaries, letter excerpts) give the book an alive atmosphere.<br/><br/>Did I learn anything? Before this book, I thought the American civil war started because Lincoln outlawed slavery, and then people died, and then slavery was gone. Battles may have involved Velociraptors, and at some point Bill and Ted appeared and stole Lincoln thus probably ending the war.<br/><br/>In reality, the war initially wasn't about the abolishment of slavery, but about the spread of slavery - Lincoln campaigned on a ticket that opposed the spread of slavery, and before he even was inaugurated, the South seceded. Interesting! <br/><br/>There's a lot of inspiring stuff about the moral background and the rather scientific way Lincoln approached each problem - rather than outright stating in his politics that slavery is wrong, he approached the problem from each possible viewpoint to see what each party believes. Some of these examinations have survived in Lincoln's private notes! Very interesting. His humble approach to problems like this, his speeches (that he held mostly himself! No empty congress) makes you feel even more depressed about the current state of democracy.<br/><br/>Two minor problems: You need to be a bit acquainted with American politics and geography to truly understand what's going on, sometimes the movements of armies are described relative to landmarks like certain rivers (and poor German me has to look at a map), sometimes the complications in US lawmaking are not fully described as this book is about Lincoln, not bureaucracy. Also: According to Wikipedia, that awesome story about hookers being named after the Union general Hooker and his party-tent during the war (making the recent affair around Petraeus seem very boring) is likely not true, the word 'hooker' has been used in the same context before the general became famous :(						0

As such, the book is quick reading, you can read one or two 'facts' on the bus.<br/><br/>Of course, the author's opinions shine through - he really doesn't like vendor salespeople (they hype too much), managers should stay out of the way of programmers since managers don't know what programming is about, etc.<br/><br/>Some of these facts I've heard by now (the book is, after all, 12 years old), some of them overlap with The Mythical Man Month, some I hadn't heard before, some don't apply to me (bioinformatics programming: where neither plan nor design prevail).<br/><br/>Just a taste for a couple of interesting facts and fallacies: <br/><br/>- projects run late mostly because of faulty schedules and estimates<br/>- most errors are errors of omitted coding logic (hard to test for)<br/>- 100% test coverage is impossible (this is now widely accepted) and useless anyway<br/>- the (average) wisdom of the software field is not increasing (what experienced programmers learn is evened out by newbies arriving, and for a long time the number of newbies is growing)<br/>- programming should be taught by reading code instead of writing it (I don't agree with that one - too frustrating to read code if you've never before seen it)<br/>- better software engineering development leads to more maintenance, not less (possibly because it's easier to add new features and change old ones)<br/>- my favourite 'fallacy': 'software needs more methodologies' - nicely summarized here: http://programming-motherfucker.com/ (NSFW language)<br/><br/>Recommended for: All programmers.<br/><br/>Bonus best quote (in itself a quote):<br/><br/><blockquote>Reality is the murder of a beautiful theory by a gang of ugly facts.</blockquote>						0
164064	Time, Love, Memory: A Great Biologist and His Quest for the Origins of Behavior	Jonathan Weiner	Weiner, Jonathan		0679763902	9780679763901	4	4.16	Vintage	Paperback	320	2000	1999	2014/05/27	2013/02/14	biology, history-of-biology	biology (#7), history-of-biology (#1)	read	A good book if your into the history of biology (genetics to be exact), and want to learn more about nature vs. nurture - how much of behaviour can be attributed to genes? The book summarizes the beginnings of genetics in the fruitfly, and describes the beginnings of research into the genetic bases for the feeling of time, of sexuality, and for memory in fruitflies. <a href='https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/736269411?book_show_action=false&page=1'>Like Bastian</a> I didn't know anything about Benzer before, so that was an eye-opening experience - and it's cool to read about how all the 'big names' like Watson, Feynman etc. fit into the history of genetics.<br/><br/>Sometimes, the author looses a bit of control over his metaphors and, in my opinion, makes the gene -> phenotype connection too simplistic. All direct quotations of Benzer do it 'right' (if there is such a thing) - Benzer is very cautious in making any comparison between humans and fly behaviour, for example. <br/><br/>Weiner on the other hand uses emotional formulations like 'Biologists who hate sociobiology maintain that we can learn very little about human nature by studying the instincts of other animals' (p 216) - it's not that I <i>hate</i> sociobiology, it's that I think that a lot of people (journalists more than scientists) hype it more than it deserves. Weiner presents some examples of genes in human behaviour that by now are outdated, and he gives them more merit than they deserve, even back then. For example, he links Xq28 stronger to human male homosexuality more than the evidence of the 90s allows for (IMHO). In these parts the book clearly shows its age, biology has become more cautious in the last decade. A very recent example is the discovery of <a href='http://www.nature.com/news/male-researchers-stress-out-rodents-1.15106'>how the mere presence of male researchers influences the behaviour of laboratory mice</a>.<br/><br/>The biggest annoyance to me was the treatment of Lewontin in this book, Weiner presents him as some kind of outdated cold war relic, something like the last Marxist, a unicorn of science - if I remember correctly, he's the only one given negative adjectives in the book ('he's loathed and feared', p 256). I've read other things by Lewontin - he had quite a bit of influence in evolutionary biology that this book omits, he published a bit with Stephen Jay Gould, and his thinking is still influential (and should be more widely spread). I don't think he deserves to be loathed - can someone be loathed who co-invented <a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isadore_Nabi'>Isadore Nabi</a>? [1]<br/><br/>But it's still a good book, just take it with a grain of salt (as <a href='https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/736269411?book_show_action=false&page=1'>Bastian</a> correctly says) - it pulls some of the 'quieter', maybe slightly forgotten characters of science into the foreground.<br/><br/>Recommended for: <br/>- People who want to know what a single person can achieve in their life with inspiration and lots of hard work.<br/>- People interested in the history of science, especially genetics.<br/><br/>[1] Now that I think about it, Isadore Nabi should have gotten <a href='http://www.smbc-comics.com/?id=2853'>the first statue of Darwin looking doubtful</a> for his essay <a href='http://www.autodidactproject.org/other/sn-nabi1.html'>An Evolutionary Interpretation of the English Sonnet</a>.<br/><br/><br/>-----------------------------------------------------------<br/><br/>Update 2014-7-1:<br/><br/>For those interested, one of the chapters describes how the <i>period</i> gene may have something to do with a supposed courtship song in <i>Drosophila</i>: last week research was published that showed this song is just an artefact of data binning. <a href='http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcblog/2014/06/26/can-you-show-us-that-again-please/'>Here's the blog post</a> by the lead author.						0

I tried to read it in one evening but had to stop at 4am.<br/><br/>It's the story of how one US astronomer turned computer programmer (""astroinformatician""?) found a 75 cents bill for computing time he couldn't make sense of, how he traced that bill, found an intruder on his system, and how it took him months to untangle the web of systems the hacker used to disguise himself.<br/><br/>Stoll had a very interesting scientific way in which he approached the problem of an intruder, which resonated with me strongly: he kept neat lab-books of everything that happened, he thought clearly about each step, and all the little details they used to infer more about the hacker are splendid.<br/><br/>For example, on login the hacker kept on using ""ps -eafg"" to see who was logged in, but ""-f"" was superfluous under Berkeley Unix, which indicated that the hacker was used to AT&T Unix, which  wasn't used on the US West Coast. Therefore it was more likely that the intruder was from the US East Coast, or from abroad.<br/><br/>(Another fun thing about the age of this book - it's clearly written for the layman in 1989, so things that are completely basic today are explained in long terms - ""electronic mail"", for example)<br/><br/>It becomes a fun cat and mouse game - it's always the same intruder (who turned out to be <spoiler>urmel/Markus Hess from Germany</spoiler>), Stoll tried to get the US government involved, but no agency wanted to have anything to do with it - neither the FBI, nor the CIA, nor the NSA had anything to do with computer break-ins, there were no laws yet, nothing (the events in this book happen around 1986-87, I was just a few months old).<br/><br/>It's great fun to read how each step in the plan worked out, how Stoll laid traps, each step in his thinking is detailed (the joys of writing everything down!).<br/><br/>You'll especially love this if you (like me) grew up fascinated with German ""hacker culture"" of the late 80s, early 90s, back when the Chaos Computer Club started to become a name. I got the biggest smile from this little dialogue:<br/><br/><blockquote><br/>""Can you identify who's breaking in?""<br/>""One guy uses the pseudonym Hagbard. Another, Pengo.""<br/></blockquote><br/><br/>I'm pretty sure every German ""computer person"" knows who hagbard was. We've all seen the movie ""23"", and if you haven't, you greatly owe it to yourself, it's one of my favorite German movies (even Robert Anton Wilson, who co-wrote ""Illuminatus!"", has a small part playing himself). It portrays the KGB hacks from hagbard alias Karl Koch and his friends, which is closely connected to the story of this book, but the movie focuses on Koch, while the book focuses on the systems Hess broke in. I guess focusing on Koch made for a more interesting story - he had a relatively large cocaine habit, and he was found burned to death, with no suicide note.<br/><br/>Stoll didn't like the CCC at all - in the book he repeatedly calls them vandals, I guess because back then, it was just a couple of kids messing around, not particularly knowing what they were doing. Nowadays the CCC advises the German government on technical security matters. The Chaos Communication Congress is one of the best and biggest technology conferences in Germany (I'm proud that I once held a little talk there at an ungodly hour together with <a href=""https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5925863-bastian-greshake"">Bastian Greshake</a>/@gedankenstuecke).<br/><br/>Another interesting side-note is that some currently very famous ""computer people"" appear shortly - such as Paul Graham and Robert T. Morris, who have since then founded several companies and are now known for ycombinator, one of the biggest Internet startup seed funding companies (possible more for ycombinator's social news site, <a href=""http://news.ycombinator.com"">Hacker News</a>)<br/><br/>If you want to read a more technical side of this, Stoll first published a paper: <a href=""http://pdf.textfiles.com/academics/wilyhacker.pdf"">Stalking The Wily Hacker</a>.<br/><br/>I wonder how much the events in this book, and the book itself, made Snowden's revelations possible... Would the NSA ever have started to try and control the entire Internet if the Soviet Union had never started to pay hackers for information? <br/><br/>Recommended for: Computer people, those interested in the history of the Internet, those who enjoyed playing Uplink<br/><br/>Not recommended for: People who want to think that the Internet is Facebook"						0

H. Holmes</a>, one of the first serial killers, who built a castle which was by coincidence located very close to the fair. His murders started before and ended after the fair, he even took some of his victims to the fair. The third story is the one of <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patrick_Eugene_Prendergast"">Patrick Prendergast</a>, mentally ill newspaper distributor, he shot and killed the mayor of Chicago on the second-to-last day of the fair [2].<br/><br/>It's such a strange mix: especially in the beginning you wonder who could possibly be interested in a mix of ""history of architecture"" and ""true crime"", but around the middle it picks up, you get to learn that the Ferris wheel, this staple of country fairs around the world, was developed for the Chicago World's Fair to ""out-Eiffel Eiffel"", that this fair was one of the main reasons why AC is the standard, the fair had its own police force with the task to (wow) <i>prevent</i> crime, not investigate it after it happened, etc. pp.<br/><br/>The story of Holmes is interesting if you're into ""true crime"", this story of a psychopath building his own murder castle with gas chambers and kiln. If this were fiction you wouldn't believe it.<br/><br/>Recommended for: Americans interested in their own history, the author often goes into small interesting tangents featuring famous characters of American history (do you know Susan B. Anthony? Katharine Lee Bates? I didn't; I did know Buffalo Bill, but only because Disneyland Paris runs a copy of his show)<br/><br/>[1] After Columbus, not after the country<br/>[2] He was tried as sane because he left the sixth chamber in his revolver empty, in case the gun accidentally goes off."						0

We're often deceived by the simplicity with which System 1 generates an answer, and this book is full of examples on problems arising from our ""lazy"" brains. For example, if we think about a person's qualities System 1 will fill in unknown based on how much we like the person (the Halo effect). Or, during a sale a person makes a unrealistically high starting offer - and even though we dismiss it, our brains base all other thoughts on that ""anchor"" (so it's called the anchoring effect). The book is full of effects like that - effects which might undermine your sense of reality. <br/><br/>Only 40-50% of the book is about the two systems - the rest is about the problems economy has with psychology, in which the author makes fun of economy's unrealistic assumptions that humans are completely rational; and the rest is also about the experiencing and the remembering self - we judge events not really on what we experience, but on what we remember, and there are myriad ways to trick or influence these memories. For example, we can ""taint"" an experience by adding an unpleasant memory to the end of the experience - people automatically judge the full experience worse than before, regardless of everything that precedes the unpleasant memory!<br/><br/>The only problems I had: Kahneman loves to list examples to strengthen his points, so some corners of the book are <i>slow</i>! Also, his relatively dry writing style may be off-putting to some.<br/><br/>Recommended for: People interested in clear thinking. Decision-makers. Scientists.

It's a long rambling hilarious yarn, there's no overbearing structure, it's just adventure (in the form of pirating and pillaging), followed by hanging around at home for a while, getting drunk and fighting, and then a bit more adventure (but no pillaging, only treasure hunting). I'd wager that on average, someone dies a violent but glorious death every three pages.<br/><br/>It's a world where death isn't particularly scary, as long as others got a good story out of it and you died fighting everything's going to be alright. For example, one guy with long beautiful hair tells the story of how his hair saved his life. He was captured by Norwegians (IIRC) who proceeded to cut off their prisoners heads, he asked whether someone could hold his hair while they cut off his head so it doesn't get soiled with blood, so a Norwegian agrees to hold up his hair. Before the axe comes down, the young man rips his head to the front so that the executioner cuts off the hands of the Norwegian. Now normally that would be an outrage but here, the Norwegians find that ""trick"" so funny, they set the young man free. Who cares if that guy bleeds to death from his stumps! It is a good death.<br/><br/>There's no overarching structure, Orm's encounters become unbelievable at some point (he just runs into old friends in the most faraway corners of the earth), except for Orm's wife Ylva women are mostly spoils of the war, and the second half of the book seriously loses in speed, but it's still a riveting read. It's a lighthearted version of Yoshikawa's Musashi.<br/><br/>Recommended for: Fans of fiction, historical fiction or fun in general"						0
18452	The Painted Bird	Jerzy Kosiński	Kosiński, Jerzy		080213422X	9780802134226	5	3.94	Grove Press	Paperback	234	1995	1965	2014/04/13	2012/12/28	war	war (#2)	read	This review needs a trigger warning.<br/><br/>First of all, this is a brutal book, and not an easy read. There's mutilation, murder, rape, and all of these on every second page or so.<br/><br/>Set in an unspecified Eastern European state during WW2, this book details how the 10-year old narrator is separated from his parents and has to survive by drifting from tiny village to village (up until this point it's a lot like Ballard's Empire Of The Sun). Since he looks marginally different than others he's not welcome anywhere - most think he's either a Jew or a gypsy.<br/><br/>Interestingly, most of the terror and brutality in this book doesn't come from the war itself, but from the brutal stupidity and superstitions of the villagers. Ironically, the war saves the narrator several times - the Nazi army saves him twice, and the Soviet army heals his broken ribs and gives him a home. At one point, the narrator even sees Jesus in an SS-officer. <br/><br/>It's not really a book about the brutality of war - I'd argue the motif is more like 'those who belong to the group versus the outsider'. The book is full of these manifestations, war is just one manifestation of the theme. Every time the narrator arrives in a new village, he is punished for being an outsider. The holocaust itself is being portrayed as outsiders being punished by the group  (There is one brutal scene which describes how the villagers comb the tracks next to the trains going to the death-camps for anything of value, left by the prisoners; the villagers find an escaped Jewish woman, but the villagers don't help her escape - instead, is subsequently raped and killed. After all, 'she's just a Jew', an outsider). The title-giving Painted Bird is another manifestation of the theme.<br/><br/>Is all the brutality in this book realistic? I'd say yes, judging from what I heard in Germany growing up. But it isn't autobiographical in the strict sense, which seems to have disappointed a lot of people when it came out (and looking over them, some Goodreads reviews still seem to assume that it's autobiographical). If it were strictly a true story then life has more symbolism than I remembered. But that doesn't mean that the book is untrue - all of these things happened.<br/><br/>Recommended for: I'm not sure, honestly.<br/><br/>Not recommended for: Fans of The Book Thief. The squeamish. Those who believe in humans.						0

Sometimes the ideas are hard to comprehend, but Watson always does a good job to explain everything in laymen's terms, from arts to literature to economics to biology to physics, not much gets left out. But the book keeps on throwing knowledge at you, there is no time wasted - I feel like I stored maybe 1% of the contained knowledge in my brain. <br/><br/>During reading I got the impression that this book focuses mostly on the west's ideas and concepts, and Watson has a few apologetic paragraphs on this in the end, explaining that most of the new concepts that led us into this golden age have indeed developed in the west - I can't really debate him on that. I'm a biologist, and most of our groundbreaking stuff (DNA-helix, PCR, sequencing machines..) have indeed been developed in the west. <br/><br/>I did enjoy some takedowns, for example I've been taught in High School that Freud was mostly right (German classes! A lot of Mann's and other German authors' works draw heavily from Freud's (dream-)symbolism!), but here the evidence to the contrary is presented (Jung was wrong, too). <br/><br/>One of the biggest takeaways I took from this book is how no idea comes about on its own - everything is based on previous ideas, nothing is 100% new.<br/><br/>I would recommend this book to everyone eager to learn where our ""modern"" ideas (or mental models?) come from - definitely not recommended for people who can't concentrate for longer than 5 minutes."						0

He had little possessions and like a world-citizen he travelled from collaborator to collaborator's couch, staying at each house for a few weeks until another theorem was proven.<br/><br/>Since it's a book about an influential mathematician, pretty much all of the greats of mathematics show up, so the book doubles as a history of modern mathematics, starting with Gauss. If you're into maths some parts of the books might bore you, as the book often sidesteps to explain the background of a particular proof or problem, which you'll probably have heard of already. If you're not into maths, the book might kindle a new love for you, who knows. The author clearly works to make the proofs and conundrums understandable for 'ordinary' people.<br/><br/>Erdős was clearly full of love, always visiting mathematicians' mothers, looking after other peoples' children, never very caring about the order or status of collaborations on papers' authors [1], eschewing wealth and stability for a life of doing what he loved, often donating what money he had to a particular cause he read about in the newspaper, or sending it to struggling mathematicians. In that regard, the book's title isn't <i>that</i> well-chosen, it's probably based on his lack of romantic and sexual love - the book hints towards a severe phimosis or something similar, and a general lack of understanding of women. <br/><br/>The book shines in fun anecdotes about Erdős' life - he buttered his first bread at the ripe old age of 21, he never had a driver's license, he was extremely dependent on his mother, he usually gave away what little money he had, he got lost on a 5-minutes walk, on seeing the solution for the Monty Hall Problem he got angry and didn't understand it for a few days (that made me feel better - that particular solution is so counter-intuitive, I'm still not sure I understood it), he called children epsilons, God the Supreme Fascist, women bosses, he read only one fiction novel in his life (<a href='https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/433567.Flatland'>Flatland</a>, what else?) and more..<br/><br/>Recommended for: People who like interesting people.<br/><br/>Not recommended for: Heartless robots.<br/><br/>[1] I can talk for hours how picky scientists can get about that, entire projects with hundreds of scientists have been severely delayed because some ego insisted on being author Nr. 12 instead of 13. It's one of the more annoying aspects of scientific work.<br/><br/>P.S.: I want to steal his epitaph: 'Finally, I am becoming stupider no more'						0

Post-apocalypse is such a large ""meme"" that post-apoc media has its own list on Wikipedia: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_apocalyptic_and_post-apocalyptic_fiction<br/><br/>This one has an interesting twist in that it's about what happens <i>before</i> a known apocalypse, it's ""pre-apocalyptic"", so to speak. A meteorite is on collision course with earth, people know the exact date the collision is going to occur, but not where it's going to strike exactly. People do however know what's going to happen: a massive explosion causing a tsunami, followed by extreme weather all around the globe (remember the dinosaurs?). This knowledge leads to an interesting society, where the market has collapsed, the price for weapons and canned food has skyrocketed, suicides happen by the minute, society is crumbling but governments still exist.<br/><br/>The novel details the first couple of months of the freshly appointed detective Hank Palace, who found one of the many suicides and thinks that something's a little bit off with it, possibly a murder. I loved his character - a bit dreamy and a bit confused about life in general, if he'd work with me in academia he would perfectly fit in. It's his first murder investigation, and even though people around him disappear to tick off items from their bucketlists, he keeps on going, he always wanted this, but is unsure whether he actually likes it. <br/><br/>The world is well-built, sometimes it's a bit boring, but all in all I'd definitely liked the book - satisfying ending, too. I recently finished Ellis' Gun Machine and The Last Policeman feels much more ""alive"", with characters you'd definitely encounter in any given university-town.<br/><br/>Recommended for: post-apoc fans, people who like crime-novels but are annoyed by the usual setting.<br/><br/>Not recommended for: people who can't read about suicide."						0

(Except that it's a plane and not a ship, and instead of Mulder & Scully we get some hey-we-hooked-up-once couple working for the CDC) <br/><br/>Should have checked before I started reading this book, it's essentially a re-telling of Dracula in a modern setting, with a bit of biological explanation to vampirism. Some of the more scary scenes are well-written (that's why I gave it two stars), the rest is boring and predictable.						0

Especially the second to last chapter feels more like an essay ""pro group selection"" than a chapter in a biography. Mentioning the introduction of myxomatosis to Australia with subsequent loss of lethality as a sign of group selection is weird - the more virulent individuals just died faster, leaving the less virulent individuals alive, you don't need to invoke group selection for that (remember Occam's razor?).<br/><br/>Anyway, highly recommended."						0

Because that life was long and complicated the book is with 944 pages big enough to kill a cat, there's enough Japanese names to confuse any non-Japanese person (how many names are there? 500? Even the main guy's name changes three times!) and it's easily the most epic book I've read in the last 10 years (the Internet ruined the word ""epic"", by the way). <br/><br/>The book details the life of Hideyoshi from son of a poor country warrior, to wandering salesman, to personal page, to soldier, to leader of a regiment, to trusted retainer to finally leader of the entire clan. <br/><br/>There's a billion small stories about a country which attitudes are completely alien to me, one example is: Hideyoshi is laying siege to a castle, the enemy's leader doesn't want to give in, Hideyoshi doesn't want to lose thousands of soldiers in storming the castle, so he has a messenger approach the enemy general directly, asking him to commit suicide so that Hideyoshi can take the castle and everyone can safely go home. The general happily agrees (after all, his family and soldiers don't have to die, and he doesn't loose face), he commits ritual suicide on a boat in front of witnesses, everybody is happy and the campaign can continue. It's weird, but interesting.<br/><br/>The style may not be anyone's cup of tea, here's a pretty central paragraph:<br/><br/><blockquote><br/>How boring would be a life lacking the confusions of many digressions or the difficult struggles! How soon would a man grow tired of living if he only walked peacefully along a level path. In the end, a man's life lies in a continuous series of hardships and struggles, and the pleasure of living is not in the short spaces of rest.<br/></blockquote><br/><br/>As you can see, it's a very ""grandiose"" style, but one that I find makes it relatively easy to read, took me about 2 weeks to read the entire book. There are a couple of downsides - I don't think Hideyoshi makes a single mistake in the entire book, which I find hard to believe, and judging from the Wikipedia-article on him it looks like his life isn't that well documented that you can safely say ""these things actually happened"". He's got a couple of mistresses but that's all the ""bad"" there is to him, the rest of the story he's the most perfect human being imaginable, which makes it boring here and there. <br/><br/>One interesting side-effect is that you learn so much about warfare in Japan of the 15th and 16th century that the entire movie ""The Last Samurai"" is revealed as the complete bollocks that it is. <br/><br/>Recommended for:<br/>- fans of historical fiction or ancient Japan, Samurais cutting off each others' heads, Ninjas murdering people, people who like to read about ritual suicide every 50 pages or so, people who like to see long plans work out nicely<br/>- people who like to play Total War: Shogun <br/><br/>Not recommended for:<br/>- people who can't distinguish ""Nobuo"" from ""Nobutada"" or ""Nobunaga"" (these three are different, but related and quite important characters)<br/>"						0

Why this also introduced quasi-post-apocalyptic stretches of land with roving gangs of children in what feels like the rest of the world is apparently left to the reader's imagination.<br/><br/>How society is supposed to progress when no-one has any time to learn is also left to the reader's imagination. <br/><br/>The main guy Logan is a <i>sandman</i> whose sole job is to go around and shoot <i>runners</i>, people whose time has expired and are on the run. He is of course perfectly trained for this task - until his time expires and he runs away. How he goes from ""system-loving exterminator"" to ""freedom-lover"" is also left to the reader's imagination, it just kinda happens from one page to the other. <br/><br/>He is, of course, not alone, being accompanied by a Jessica, whose sole responsibility in the book is to be the mirror for Logan's thoughts. She's not good for anything else, in fact, she's more useless than a stoned teenager in a horror-movie and, as a character, flatter than a square. Her inexplicable uselessness mostly serves to progress the plot. At one point she has to have sex with a bad guy while Logan has to have sex with six women (the entourage of the bad guy). I don't know why that happened.<br/><br/>This book introduces <i>some</i> Sci-Fi ideas, but doesn't follow their train of thought anywhere - the story rather focusses on the flight of the pair (which - spoiler! - at one point falls in love with each other, another thing which is an absolute miracle - it's not like they really ever talk about anything, or interact, or grow as humans), so if you're more into action with plot that has more holes than my teeth this book might be for you, but -<br/><br/>I don't know who might like this book. People who liked the movie and have some nostalgic soft spot? I never saw that movie, can't tell. People who like cheesy terrible books? Go for it! It's quite short (that's good)."						0

I mean, <i>look at that name!</i><br/><br/>It's 4 short-stories with the same main character and the same spaceship woven into one book. The main guy seems to be the proto-Spock - a guy trained in a new science called Nexialism, some kind of ""all-sciences-into-one"" with hints of individualism/libertarianism with a healthy dose of what science-fiction in the 50s was like (electronic telepathy, mind-controlling, funky big machines etc).<br/><br/>Each story is about the crew encountering an unknown, but superior alien organism. The first story is a LOT like the first Alien movie (I think the author sued and got some money), and each time the main guy, thanks to his superior intellect and background, defeats the alien using <i>logic</i> (and his gadgets). It's sometimes amusing to see how he prevails over some of the egomaniacs on board, or how well his long ago laid out plans work out, yet sometimes it's too much <i>deus ex machina</i> for my tastes.<br/><br/>Still, great fun if you're into old science-fiction, soft sci-fi or when you ""love it when a plan comes together""."						0

So if you're looking for a manual for life, you might have to look elsewhere (try the Essais! Or maybe Gracian's ""The art of worldly wisdom""?).<br/><br/>This book is a biography of Michel de Montaigne, former mayor of Bordeaux, French statesman and author of the Essais, a ~1300 pages long collection of short and long essays (one might say blog-posts today) on all matters of things, from politics of the time to how to live properly like a stoic, that made him famous in his lifetime in the 16th century and is still famous today. In the Essais Montaigne describes his personal philosophy (without ever calling it so) of a sceptic stoicism (as well as a million other things, from his life to his politics to his sex-life).<br/><br/>At times dry and funny,<br/><br/><blockquote><br/>As the modern critic David Quint has summed it up, Montaigne would probably interpret the message for humanity in Christ's crucifixion as being ""Don't crucify people"".<br/></blockquote><br/><br/>at other times horrifying (for example, descriptions of atrocities of the French protestant/catholic civil wars), this book is a collection of questions and short answers which serve as loose starting-points for certain aspects of Montaigne's life and works. The book likes to follow Montaigne's loosely connected ""rambling"" style (several times it jumps forward to the death of Montaigne, then back to some political aspect of this work, then to developments in modern criticisms of the Essais, then back to descriptions of his wife), quite enjoyable if you're prepared to jump around a bit. <br/><br/>The book itself is written in a very clear, modern style, I can't find any ""stiff"" non-fiction-style, which makes for a very enjoyable read. The short rules of Montaigne on ""How to live"" are explained using parts of his writing and his life, but the focus is clearly on his life - so this book rather serves as an introduction of his life and contemporaries, a great preparation if you're willing to tackle the main-part, the Esssais themselves. <br/><br/>Definitely recommended, for people who like biographies of unusual people, people who want to know where modern scepticism comes from, and those who love the Essais."						0

The very first essay is on ""nerds"" vs. ""non-nerds"", I'd say, and is mostly based on his own high school time. The gist of it is that nerds in high-school were the most pure beings and the only ""adults"" and oh-so-clear-sighted and just forced to put up with this prison called high-school, and how everybody else was and is just an idiot etc. pp. There's also one extremely strange essay on generating wealth that was just written, I think, because Graham is rich? It's mostly ""Rich people earn so much money because they work hard and generate a lot of wealth"", yeah, we saw in the last financial crisis how much wealth bankers generate.<br/><br/>My advice: Skip the society essays, read the programming essays."						0

The author instilled the mistakes and successes of his work on the IBM 360 Operating System in the 70s, and most of what he found still applies today. For example, wisdom like: more programmers make a project only late, and if you add programmers to an already late project, results will arrive even later. Have an architect and a manager, hopefully in two different persons. Have version control (since the book is old, it's more of a central repository of printed (!!) books that detail all changes, the outline, the design etc.). There is no silver bullet - software is inherently complex and there will never be a single technology which makes it fast/easy/cheap/error-free.<br/><br/>A large portion of the knowledge contained is more useful large companies or large projects, where you have 100 to a 1000 programmers working at the same time, so for me as a lonely bioinformatician toiling on my own code not everything is applicable. But if I look through failed projects at, for example, Kickstarter, I realize that they often just repeat mistakes people already solved in the 70s. <br/><br/><a href='https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/99038582?book_show_action=true'>This review has a good summary of the main points.</a><br/><br/>I'm giving it 4 stars since some of the examples, discussions and problems are clearly outdated by now.						0

Reading about the omnipotent Gods living in their tech-bubble inside the Culture would become boring very fast.<br/><br/>Why it's boring to read - there's nothing to learn or gain for the reader. There are some thinly veiled allegories on mankind, for example the Azad in the second culture-book, ""Player of Games"" with their useless pride and cruel society. You can find better allegories in other books, for example ""Animal Farm"", ""The Library Of Babel"" or something from Saramago. Go read these books if you want to learn about humanity.<br/><br/>Storywise it's relatively straight-forward in all books - someone from inside the culture (or in close contact to it) is sent out to investigate or help with another culture, which is either very interesting or threatening to start a war. The protagonist is usually accompanied by intelligent technology, which safes him or her from most threatening situations using, basically, magic. Sometimes the machines fail to make the story ""dangerous"", but that's it. The main character then goes and solves the conflict using his/her technological wizardry. That's it.<br/><br/>I still give it 3 stars: if you like escapism and dislike this world you live on, read these books. Great world-building and Banks' imaginative mind paired with his storytelling prowess should guarantee that you're entertained.<br/>If you want to learn anything, don't waste your time."	true					0
